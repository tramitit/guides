## Description
### What is it?
The health card in Croatia is a document that provides proof of entitlement to healthcare services funded by the Croatian Health Insurance Fund. It is essential for foreigners living in Croatia to access medical assistance.

### Who needs it?
This guide is directed towards expatriates, digital nomads, or any foreigners planning to reside in Croatia for an extended period and need to have access to healthcare services.

## Procedure
1. Apply for a residency permit: Before you can register for a health card, you must first have a valid residency permit. You can do this by applying to the local police station or [Ministry of the Interior](http://www.mup.hr/1266.aspx).

2. Apply for the national identification number (OIB): Upon approval of your residence permit, you will be issued an OIB, which is necessary for the health card application. Details about the OIB numbers can be found [here](http://www.porezna-uprava.hr/en/Pages/oib.aspx).

3. Register with the Croatian Health Insurance Fund (HZZO): This can be done at any HZZO offices. Here, you have to fill out the 'HZO-P' form and submit it alongside other required documents.

4. Pay for Health Insurance premium: Your health insurance premium will depend on various factors, including your age, income level, and whether you are employed or not.

5. Collect your Health Card: Upon successful registration and payment, your health insurance card will be issued to you after some time.

## Additional details
Participation in the Croatian state healthcare system is compulsory for all residents, including foreigners living in Croatia. The system is funded by mandatory health insurance contributions. Do note that private healthcare is also available, though it usually serves as supplementary coverage in addition to the mandatory state-provided health insurance.
