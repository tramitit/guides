## Description
### What is it?
Getting married in Croatia requires that you officially register your marriage. This is a legal process which involves several steps and requires specific documents.

### Who needs it?

## Procedure
1. Collect necessary documents. This includes birth certificates, proof of marital status, and other required documents.
