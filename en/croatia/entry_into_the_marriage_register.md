## Description
### What is it?
Getting married in Croatia requires that you officially register your marriage. This is a legal process which involves several steps and requires specific documents.

### Who needs it?

## Procedure
1. Collect necessary documents. This includes birth certificates, proof of marital status, and other required documents.
2. Get the required documents officially translated into Croatian.

5. Submit the necessary documents and pay the required fee.
