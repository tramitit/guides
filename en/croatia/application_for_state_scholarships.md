## Description

### What is it?
State scholarships are financial aid programs initiated by the state to assist students who might struggle financially with tuition fees and other educational expenses. They are usually merit-based or need-based.

### Who needs it?
Students considering pursuing higher education such as college or university, particularly those facing financial constraints, are the ideal recipients of state scholarships.

## Procedure

1. Identify the state scholarships you are eligible for.
2. Visit the state's scholarship or ministry of educations page for specific requirements.
3. Most often, there would be an online application form to fill. Enter your personal and academic information accurately.
4. Prepare a motivation letter or an essay if required. The essay topic varies but it's often about your academic journey, your future goals, or why you deserve the scholarship.
5. Submit your application before the deadline along with all the necessary documents.

## Required Documents

You may need the following documents, although exact requirements may vary:

- Proof of citizenship or residency
- Academic transcripts 
- Recommendation letters from teachers or professors
- Proof of financial need such as family income 
- Confirmation of enrollment from your educational institution

Details on how to obtain these documents can usually be found on university/college and local government websites.
