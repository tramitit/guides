## Description
### What is it?
The Personal Identification Number (OIB) is a permanent number regulated by law for every Croatian citizen and is used as a unique identifier within the public administration system. It is the Croatian equivalent to the Social Security Number (SSN) in the U.S.

### Who needs it?
This document is mandatory for every Croatian citizen. Foreign citizens who live and work in Croatia or plan on doing so are also required to have an OIB.

## Procedure

1. Visit the local branch of the Croatian Tax Administration (Porezna Uprava). You can find your local branch on their website [here](https://www.porezna-uprava.hr/en/Pages/default.aspx).

2. Ask for an OIB application form and fill it out. Make sure that all the information you provide is accurate and complete.

3. Submit the application form alongside necessary identification.

4. After approval, an OIB will be issued to you.

Please note: The actual issuance process may take a few weeks.

## Required Documents

For Croatian residents

- Identification Card (ID card or passport)

For non-residents

- Passport
- Residence permit or another proper document proving the legal stay in Croatia.

Note: Please ensure that you have all original documents and their copies.

## Additional details
There is no direct online application process. Therefore, the only way to obtain an OIB is by visiting a tax office physically. The OIB remains valid for a lifetime, irrespective of changes in personal status, domicile, residency or citizenship.
