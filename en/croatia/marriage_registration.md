## Description
### What is it?
Marriage registration is the official recognition and recording of a marriage by a government organization. In Croatia, this takes place in a registrar's office (Matični Ured).

### Who needs it?
Any couple that wishes to be legally married in Croatia.

## Procedure
The procedure to register a marriage in Croatia follows these broad steps:

1. Check the requirements: Begin by checking the marriage requirements for Croatia as well as any cultural or religious ceremonies you wish to include in your nuptials.
   
2. Submit the Request: You need to submit a request for marriage (Marriage Application) to the local registrar's office (Matični Ured). This has to be done in person by both partners.

3. Schedule the date: After the submission of your application, you can then schedule the date of your civil marriage ceremony. This must occur within the next 45 days but not sooner than in 30 days.

4. The Ceremony: The civil marriage ceremony takes place at the Registrar's Office or a location of your choosing in the presence of a Civil Registrar. At least two witnesses must be present.

5. Marriage Certificate: After the ceremony, the civil registrar hands over the marriage certificate (Marriage Certificate / Svjedodžba o sklapanju braka) to the couple.


## Required Documents
The following documents will typically be required during the process:

- Valid ID or Passport
- Birth Certificates
- Proof of termination of any previous marriages, if applicable (e.g. divorce certificate, death certificate)
- Residence Certificates
- Marriage Application form

*Note: All documents need to be in Croatian or officially translated into Croatian, and may need to be annotated (legally confirmed authentic) by the respective institution in your home country.*
