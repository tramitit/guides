## Description
### What is it?
A marriage certificate certifies that two individuals are legally married. In Croatia, this certificate is obtained after the legal marriage ceremony has been performed.
### Who needs it?
This process is necessary for anyone who plans to get married in Croatia, whether they are a resident or a foreigner.

## Procedure
1. Contact the local Registrar's Office (Maticni Ured) in the city where you plan to marry. You can find a list of these offices on the Croatian Government's e-Citizens portal [here](https://e-građani.gov.hr/).

2. Set the wedding date and time with the Registrar's Office.

3. Prepare and submit all required documents (see the list below). These should be submitted at least 30 days before the planned wedding date. 

4. After your documents have been reviewed and approved, you will receive a marriage document in Croatian. 

5. On your wedding day, the marriage ceremony will be performed by a representative from the Registrar's Office. 

6. After the ceremony, you will receive your marriage certificate.

## Required Documents
- Original birth certificates for both parties.
- A valid ID or passport.
- A certificate of free marital status, to confirm that you're not currently married. 
- In case of previous marriages, a divorce certificate or death certificate.
- For foreigners, these documents should be translated into Croatian.
