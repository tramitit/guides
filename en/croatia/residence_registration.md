## Description
### What is it?
Residence registration is a mandatory procedure for those living in Croatia both permanently and on a temporary basis. It provides a proof of your legal status in the state and is necessary for various local procedures and transactions.

### Who needs it?
Every foreigner who lives in Croatia, be it for work, study or long-term stay purposes, is required to go through the residence registration.

## Procedure
1. You typically need to register within a few days of your arrival in the country. 
2. Go to the local police station where you will be residing. If you're staying in smaller locations, the local community office might be responsible for residence registration.
3. Provide all required documents (see the 'Required Documents' section).

## Required Documents
- A filled out 'application for registration of temporary residence',
- A copy of a valid Travel Document,
- A valid passport or identity card,
- Proof of accommodation; could be a rent contract/lease agreement,
- Proof of sufficient financial means for your stay in Croatia,
- Health Insurance valid in the territory of the Republic of Croatia.

## Additional details
- Sometimes the person who owns the place you will be staying at may also need to accompany you for the registration process.
- The law requires that foreigners register their residence within two days of moving to a new abode. The residence must be verified by a police officer visiting your home or by the landlord's written statement confirming the foreigner's residence at the given address.
- Exceptions may apply to citizens of EU countries. Always consult with the official guidelines provided by the Croatian Ministry of the Interior.
- Keep in mind that you are required by law to report any change of address within 15 days of moving, to the local police. This means that if you move, you must repeat the process and register your new address.
- Upon successful completion of the procedure, you'll receive a Confirmation of the Temporary Residence. You should keep it throughout your stay in the country since you may need it for other procedures.
