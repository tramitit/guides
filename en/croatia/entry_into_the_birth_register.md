## Description
### What is it?
Birth registration in Croatia is a process that certifies the details of a birth. It is a legal requirement in Croatia for every newborn child.
### Who needs it?
This process is necessary for anyone who has given birth in Croatia or has a child with Croatian citizenship.

## Procedure
1. Obtain the required documents (more details in the following section).
2. Visit the local administrative bodies responsible for maintaining the Register of Births. In Croatia, this is typically the local Registrar office.
3. Submit the required documents to the relevant officials.
4. Your documents will be reviewed, and the birth certificate will be issued.
5. Keep a copy of the birth certificate for your records.

## Required Documents
- Medical certificate of birth issued by the hospital or a birth certificate from the doctor or midwife who delivered the baby.
- Identity documents of parents (national ID or passport).
- Proof of parents' citizenship (birth certificate or passport).
- If parents are not married, proof of acknowledgment of paternity, or a court ruling on paternity, or a sworn statement confirming that the mother lived with a foreign citizen.

## Providers that can do it for you

| Provider        |     Website     |     Timelines    |       Cost      |
| --------------- | --------------- |  :-------------: | :-------------: |
| Not applicable  |                 |                  |                 |

There are no explicit providers for this service as it is typically carried out by the individual with guidance from hospital and local authorities.

## Additional details
- Timelines might vary on a case by case basis. Please allow for potential delays.
- Croatian law states that newborn babies should be registered within 15 days after birth.
- In the case of Croatian citizens who give birth abroad, the birth can still be registered in Croatian registries. The documents required remain the same, but they must be translated into Croatian by a certified translator and authenticated according to the rules of the country of birth. The local diplomatic mission or consular post of Croatia can assist with this process.
