3. Pay the health insurance premium as required. The value may vary depending on your status (student, professional, etc).

## Additional details
Ensure that your health insurance is always active, and it covers your needs, especially when in need of medical attention or hospitalization. Some pharmacies may decline service if your health insurance is not valid, while hospital costs without insurance can be notably high.

Additionally, different rules could apply for European Union (EU) citizens. It is recommended to check with the health insurance provider about the same.
