## Description
### What is it?
An immigration permit, also known as a residence permit, is a document that gives non-Croatian citizens the right to live, study, work, or do business in Croatia for an extended period.
### Who needs it?
Anyone who is a non-Croatian citizen and wishes to remain in Croatia for a period longer than 90 days needs an immigration permit.

## Procedure
1. First, you would need to secure a reason or purpose for your long-term stay in Croatia such as employment, studies, family reunification, or scientific research. This will form the base for your application.

2. Apply for a temporary residence visa (type D visa), which you would do in the Croatian embassy or consulate in your home country.

3. After entering Croatia with a D visa, you should apply for a temporary residence permit within the first 90 days of your stay. This is done at the local police station in Croatia.

4. Finally, if the application for a temporary residence permit is approved, you'll be issued a biometric residence permit card.

## Required Documents
- Valid passport
- Purpose of stay (employment contract, enrolment confirmation from a Croatian educational institution, etc.)
- Proof of health insurance 
- Proof of sufficient financial means for the duration of your stay
- Proof of accommodation in Croatia (rented, bought, or otherwise)

Note: Additional documents may be required depending on the purpose of your stay.

- Once issued, the permit is valid for one year and can be renewed. 

- If your application for a residence permit is rejected, you do have the right to appeal. Appeals should be conducted with the assistance of a legal professional to ensure correct procedure is followed.
