## Description
### What is it?
Newborn registration is a vital record in the civil register. It serves to officially recognize the arrival of a new family member, define the child's identity, and offer them legal rights and protection.

### Who needs it?
Any parent or guardian who has recently had a child born within the boundaries of Croatia needs to register the newborn to ensure their rights and benefits.

## Procedure
1. Contact your local registrar's office (municipality or city office) where the childbirth took place. 
2. You may need to provide information such as the date, time, and location of the birth, as well as details regarding the parents.
3. Follow the instructions provided by the registrar's office in regards to documentation and additional steps.
4. After the submission of required documents and approval, the newborn's birth certificate will be issued.

## Required Documents
These documents are typically asked for during the newborn registration procedure:
1. Proof of childbirth: This could be a hospital document or a document from a doctor or midwife.
2. Identification documents: Both parents' passports or ID cards.
3. Marriage certificate: If applicable, the parents' original marriage certificate.

## Additional details
Registration of a newborn must typically be done within a month of the child's birth. In the event that the parents do not manage to register the child's birth within the set timeframe, they may be subjected to a minimal fine. The process may slightly vary depending on your specific local authorities. Always reach out to your local registrar's office for the most accurate information.
