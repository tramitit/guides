## Description
### What is it?
A birth certificate is an official document that states the information about a person's birth. This document is a key form of identification and is crucial for various legal processes.

### Who needs it?
Anyone born in Croatia, or has put in a claim for Croatian citizenship by descent of a relative born in Croatia, needs a Croatian birth certificate. It is needed to authenticate your identification for various administrative and legal procedures.

## Procedure
1. Visit the Croatian vital statistics office (Matični ured) in the city where the birth was registered.
2. Request for a Birth Certificate (Rodni List)
3. Pay the administrative fees
4. Provide the required documents for verification

## Required Documents
Birth certificates in Croatia are issued based on an extract from the Birth Register. To obtain a birth certificate, the following documents are typically required:

- Your Identification (ID card or passport)
- Proof of relation or a valid reason for requesting someone else's birth certificate
- Payment of the administration fee

These documents should be brought to the local Matični ured to be processed.
