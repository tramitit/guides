## Description
### What is it?
Changing your residence refers to the process of officially updating your registered address with the relevant government authorities. This process varies between countries, sometimes requiring notification of multiple offices or departments.

### Who needs it?
Any individual or family planning to move from their current registered address to a new one will need to undergo the change of residence process. This includes both local and international moves.

## Procedure

1. Gather all necessary documentation (see the 'Required Documents' section).
2. Visit your local administrative office to notify them of your plans to move. In some countries, such as Croatia, you would visit the police station to complete this step. 
3. Fill out the required forms detailing your new address.
4. Submit the forms along with your documentation.
5. Await confirmation of your change of residence. This often comes in the form of an updated residence card or certificate.

## Required Documents

- Proof of Identity (passport, driver's license, or ID card)
- Proof of new address (property title, lease agreement, utility bill)
- Completed change of residence form (obtained from local authorities)

## Providers that can do it for you

## Additional details

- For international moves, consult both the emigration and immigration authorities in your current and new countries of residence respectively.
- Some financial institutions or services such as Revolut may require separate updates to your registered address.
- Remember to also update your address with any other services or subscriptions you may have (banks, magazines, mail forwarding services etc.).
