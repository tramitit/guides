## Description
### What is it?
Stay registration is a process by which foreign visitors report their presence to the local authorities in the country they are visiting. In Croatia, this is a legal requirement within 48 hours of arrival. 

### Who needs it?
All non-EU citizens staying in Croatia for more than 90 days within a 180 day period are required to register their stay. Additionally, those who are staying in accommodation not classified as a hospitality property (like a friend's house) must also register, regardless of their length of stay.

## Procedure

1. Upon arrival in Croatia, locate the nearest police department dealing with foreign affairs. 
2. Provide them with the necessary documentation (see the next section) to report your presence.
3. The authorities will process your information and provide you with a registration slip. 

## Required Documents

You will need the following documents for stay registration:

1. Valid passport
2. Information about your place of stay: address, type (rented, owned, staying with friends/family etc).
3. Depending on the duration and purpose of your stay additional documents may be required such as:
   - work permit if working 
   - matriculation certificate for students 
   - proof of sufficient funds to support yourself throughout your stay 
   
To verify the necessary documents, refer to the official website of the Ministry of the Interior, [here](https://mup.gov.hr/).

## Providers that can do it for you

Unfortunately, the registration of stay must be done personally.

## Additional details

Tourism businesses such as hotels, hostels and campsites have obligations to handle the registration on behalf of their guests. Private accommodation hosts should also be aware of this requirement. Failing to register could result in fines, so it's important to ensure your host is aware of this requirement.
