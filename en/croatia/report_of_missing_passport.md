## Description
### What is it?
This refers to the process of reporting a lost or stolen passport. It ensures authorities are informed about the missing document to prevent misuse and to facilitate the process of acquiring a new one. 
### Who needs it?
Any individual who has lost their passport or had it confiscated or stolen while in Croatia, or any other country, will need to go through this process.

## Procedure
1. If you're a victim of a passport or visa crime, your first action should be contacting the local police and reporting the theft.
2. Obtain a copy of the police report or any document confirming the report of the theft.
3. Contact your country's embassy or consulate in Croatia. You can find the contact information on your country's foreign affairs ministry website. 
4. Provide the embassy or consulate with the copy of your police report and any other required details.
5. Follow instructions given by the embassy or consulate to get an emergency travel document to return to your country or to apply for a replacement passport.

## Required Documents
- Copy of the police report for the lost or stolen passport
- Identification document (driver's license, ID card, etc.), if available.
- Two passport photos.
- Proof of citizenship or copy of your missing passport, if available.

## Additional details
Remember, after the loss or theft, the passport is invalidated and can no longer be used for travel, even if it's found again. It's important to report the loss immediately to prevent identity theft or other forms of misusage. To reenter your home country, you'll likely need an emergency travel document issued by your embassy or consulate.
Always keep additional identification documents and photocopies of your passport separately. It can facilitate the process of obtaining a new passport or an emergency travel document. If you're travelling, make sure you have travel insurance covering such emergencies.
