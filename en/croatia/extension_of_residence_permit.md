## Description
### What is it?
The extension of a residence permit is a process which allows a non-national individual to legally continue staying within a foreign country for a further fixed period after their initial permit has expired.

### Who needs it?
This guide is mainly targeted towards non-Croatian residents who are legally living in Croatia and wish to extend their stay, including individuals such as digital nomads, expatriates, and long-term tourists.

## Procedure

1. Prior to the expiration of your current residence permit, apply for the extension at the local police station. 
2. Complete the application form for the extension of temporary stay. The application form is available on the official website of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
3. After filling the application, submit it with the required documents to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
4. Pay the administrative fee.
5. Wait for the approval. 

## Required Documents

- Copy of valid travel document (passport)
- Proof of health insurance
- Proof of sufficient funds for subsistence
- Typically, for digital nomads, a rental contract that has been notarized is required.

## Providers that can do it for you

## Additional details
- It's imperative to apply for the extension before your current permit expires. Overstaying your visa can result in penalties, including deportation and bans from reentry.
- The rental contract needs to be notarized for use in official procedures. This can be done at a local notary office.
- The process may take from several weeks to a few months. It's recommended to initiate the process early before the expiration of your current permit.
