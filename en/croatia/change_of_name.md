## Description
### What is it?
A change of name involves altering the moniker that identifies you personally, or represents your dynasty or realm in game applications or personalized ticket purchases for events. In some circumstances, it may be necessary to reflect an alteration to your identity that has occurred for personal, legal or other reasons.

### Who needs it?
The ideal customer profile includes anyone who needs to change their personal information for legal reasons, personal security, or preference. It may also include players of various online games or customers who participate in event purchases that require name customization.

## Procedure
(Note that the specific steps may vary depending on your location and the specific circumstances requiring a name change)
1. Determine the reason for the name change and validate its legality or relevance.
2. Prepare all required documents as proof for the need to change the name.
3. Apply for a name change application in the appropriate agencies or customer supports.
4. Submit all required documents and fill up necessary forms.
5. Wait for processing.
6. Once approved, you can now start using your new name. Notify relevant agencies, companies, and acquaintances of your new name.

## Required Documents
1. A valid identification card/document.
2. Proof of residence.
3. Legal proof or logic behind the name change, if applicable (like marriage certificate or court order).

Always remember to communicate with relevant organizations about your new name to prevent unexpected issues such as identity inconsistencies and others.

Be sure to acknowledge all implications and possible consequences that a name change might imply.
