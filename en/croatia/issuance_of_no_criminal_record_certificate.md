## Description
### What is it?
A no criminal record certificate (also known as certificate of conduct or police clearance certificate) is an official document which certifies that the holder of the certificate has no criminal record.

### Who needs it?
This certificate is often required by individuals who are applying for immigration, obtaining visas or work permits, adopting a child, or for other similar purposes.

## Procedure

1. Prepare the necessary documents which are required for acquiring a no criminal record certificate. 

2. Apply in-person or through a trusted representative at the nearest police station or the relevant government authority in your country.
   
3. Pay the required fee.

4. The certificate should be ready for collection after a certain period (usually within a fortnight).

## Required Documents

Here are the documents you should have:

- Application form

The requirements may vary slightly depending on the laws and regulations in your country, therefore, it is always advisable to confirm from the relevant authority before starting the process.

## Additional details
In some cases, if you are required to provide this certificate for a foreign authority, it may be necessary to get it translated and notarized. Also, some countries require the certificate to be issued recently, i.e., within a certain time period before it's submission. It is highly recommended to confirm this with the authority, organization or institution requesting this document from you.
