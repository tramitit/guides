## Description
### What is it?
A no criminal record certificate (also known as certificate of conduct or police clearance certificate) is an official document which certifies that the holder of the certificate has no criminal record.

### Who needs it?
This certificate is often required by individuals who are applying for immigration, obtaining visas or work permits, adopting a child, or for other similar purposes.

## Procedure

1. Prepare the necessary documents which are required for acquiring a no criminal record certificate. 

2. Apply in-person or through a trusted representative at the nearest police station or the relevant government authority in your country.
   
3. Pay the required fee.

4. The certificate should be ready for collection after a certain period (usually within a fortnight).

## Required Documents

Here are the documents you should have:

- Application form
- Valid government-issued identity card or passport
- Proof of current address 
- Fees

The requirements may vary slightly depending on the laws and regulations in your country, therefore, it is always advisable to confirm from the relevant authority before starting the process.

## Additional details
In some cases, if you are required to provide this certificate for a foreign authority, it may be necessary to get it translated and notarized. Also, some countries require the certificate to be issued recently, i.e., within a certain time period before it's submission. It is highly recommended to confirm this with the authority, organization or institution requesting this document from you.
