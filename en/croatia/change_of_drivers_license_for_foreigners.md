## Additional details

- Croatian law does not recognise International Driving Permits (IDP) as a valid form of driver's license. Therefore, international residents must transfer their foreign driver's license to a Croatian one to legally drive within the country.
- This process does not entail taking a driving test again.
- Please note the fees may vary and additional payments may be required for official translations, and it's advisable to contact the local authorities or an expert for exact information.
