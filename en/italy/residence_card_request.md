## Description
### What is it?
Permesso di Soggiorno, also known as a residence card, is a required legal document for non-EU residents staying in Italy longer than 90 days. This is not to be confused with a Visa, but compliments it.

### Who needs it?
Non-EU citizens, including Americans who intend to reside, work or study in Italy for periods exceeding 90 days.

## Procedure

1. Arrive in Italy with a valid tourist visa (not required for Americans).

2. Find a place to live. A rental contract may be needed to prove your permanent address in Italy.

3. Go to the local Post Office (Poste Italiane) and purchase a "Kit for Foreigners" (Kit per Stranieri). An appointment will be arranged for you at the immigration office (Questura).

4. Fill the Permesso di Soggiorno module included in the Kit. This form must be completed in Italian.

5. Arrange the necessary documents including copies of passport, Italian tax code (Codice Fiscale), proof of health insurance, proof of adequate financial means among others.

6. Attend your appointment at the Questura. Submit the completed forms along with the necessary documents and pay the application fee. A receipt and another appointment date will be given.

7. Attend the second appointment and have your fingerprints taken.

8. Wait for the confirmation of your Permesso di Soggiorno via SMS or post.

## Required Documents

1. Passport or travel document
2. Photocopy of passport and Italian visa
3. 4 passport-size photos
4. Tax Code (Codice Fiscale) which can be obtained from the Revenue Agency (Agenzia delle Entrate)
