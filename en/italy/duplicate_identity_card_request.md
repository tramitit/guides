## Description
### What is it?
This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to get a duplicate Italian Identity Card. This process is suitable for those who have lost their cards or for cards that have been damaged or stolen.

### Who needs it?
The primary audience for this guide is Italians or residents in Italy who have lost their original identity cards and need to request duplicates, or individuals looking to replace damaged or stolen cards.

## Procedure

1. Report the loss or theft of your card to the local police (Carabinieri or Polizia Postale).
   
2. After filing the report, go to the town hall (Municipio or Comune) of your place of residence or an authorized Post Office (Poste Italiane). 

3. Request for the Electronic Identity Card (Carta d'Identità Elettronica, CIE). 

4. Provide the necessary documents proving your identity and residency (details in the next section).

5. Pay the required fee for the duplicate identity card. It's also possible to pay via PagoPA, the official payment system of the Public Administration.

6. Wait for a notification (either through SMS, email, or mail) for when you can collect your new Identity Card.

## Required Documents

1. Identity document (even if expired) or a passport or driver's license.

2. Police report (denuncia) for lost or stolen cards.

3. Self-certification of residence, family status, and citizenship.

4. Two passport-size photographs, with one authenticated. This differs in some municipalities, where the photos are taken on the spot via a webcam.

5. Payment receipt.

Please note that the requirements may vary depending on the municipality.
