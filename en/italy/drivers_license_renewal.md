## Description
### What is it?
Driver's License Renewal is the process of updating your authorization to legally operate a motor vehicle on public roads. In Italy, the procedure involves several steps and may require medical certification.

### Who needs it?
Any individual who holds an Italian driver's license that is nearing its expiry date needs to undergo the renewal process. It's crucial to renew your license before it expires to continue driving legally.

## Procedure
1. Start the renewal process 3 months prior to the expiration date of the driver's license.
2. Visit the local Municipality (Comune) or the Automobile Club d'Italia (ACI) office. 
3. Fill out the renewal request form (TT 2112) which can be downloaded and printed from
[Portale dell'Automobilista](https://www.ilportaledellautomobilista.it/web/portale-automobilista/modulistica).
4. Undergo a medical examination to acquire a Medical Certificate. Medical examination can be conducted by the local public health unit (ASL) or by a certified doctor. 
5. Submit the form along with the required documents and the Medical Certificate at the local Motorizzazione Civile (DMV).
6. Pay the renewal fee through a Postal Bulletin, the information of which will be given at the DMV.
7. Upon successful completion, you will receive a renewal receipt, which can be used as a temporary license until the new one arrives.

## Additional details
If you are a dual citizen, remember that the driving license of the country where you have your habitual residence is considered valid. Habitual residence refers to the place where you live for at least 185 days in a calendar year. Hence, be sure of your status before proceeding with the renewal process.
