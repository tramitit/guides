## Description
### What is it?
A Succession Declaration is a legally binding document that outlines who receives a person's property and possessions after they pass away. In Italy, inheritance laws state that assets should be distributed among the family according to specific rules. To properly handle this process, a declaration must be made.
### Who needs it?
Anyone who has unexpectedly or potentially received inheritance following the death of a loved one in Italy.

## Procedure
1. Determine if you are the legitimate heir. Italian law prescribes that certain relations to the deceased are automatically considered as heirs. These consist of children, spouses, parents, and siblings.
2. Hire a Notary (Notaio). The notary will check all documents, including the will, if there is one, and confirm if you're a legitimate heir.
3. Gather all necessary information and documents needed for the succession declaration. This includes proof of the deceased's ownership of the property.
4. Submit the prepared succession declaration document to the Italian Tax Agency (Agenzia delle Entrate) within 12 months of the person's death.
5. Pay any applicable taxes. Inheritance tax in Italy depends on the relationship between the deceased and the heir.

## Required Documents
- Death certificate of the deceased
- Proof of identification of the heir
- A copy of the last will and testament if any
- Documents supporting the deceased's ownership of the property
