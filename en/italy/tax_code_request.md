## Description
### What is it?
The Italian Tax Code, also known as the Codice Fiscale, is a personal identification number used in all interactions with Italian government services and agencies. It is a requirement for a variety of activities such as opening a bank account, signing a lease, and even buying a SIM card.

### Who needs it?
Anyone planning to reside, work, or conduct any kind of activity that involves the government or banking sector in Italy will need a Codice Fiscale. This includes short-term visitors, long-term residents, and businesses.

## Procedure

1. Gather necessary documents. You will need a valid passport, proof of residency or intended residency (a lease agreement or letter from a landlord for instance), and if relevant, a work contract or letter from an employer.
2. Download the Tax Code application form from the [Italian Revenue Agency](https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/web/guest/schede/fiscale/codice-fiscale).
3. Fill in the application form and make sure all information matches your identification documents exactly. 
4. Submit the form along with photocopies of your documents. This can be done by mail, in person, or through a representative at the nearest Italian Consulate or Embassy if you are abroad. 
5. Your Tax Code should be issued immediately if you apply in person. If you apply remotely, it will be mailed to your Italian address.

## Required Documents
