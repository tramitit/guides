## Description
### What is it?
A Death Declaration in Italy is a legal procedure aimed at informing the authorities about the death of an individual. The state needs this information to update any administrative matters related to the deceased's estate and other obligations.

### Who needs it?
Any individual responsible for managing the estate of the deceased, such as close relatives or legal executors, needs to follow this procedure.

## Procedure
1. If a person dies at home or in a public space, contact the local police department to report the death. 
2. The police will then inform the Public Health Authority, who will send a doctor to confirm the death.
3. After the doctor's confirmation, they will issue a medical certificate of death.
4. Collect the medical certificate and take it to the local registry office - "Anagrafe" in Italian. 
5. The local registry office will register the death and issue a death certificate. 

## Required Documents
- The medical certificate confirming the death, issued by the doctor
- Identification papers of the deceased (such as passport, identity card).
