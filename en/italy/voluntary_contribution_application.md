## Description
### What is it?
A Voluntary Contribution Application is a process through which individuals can make additional contributions to their pension funds or social security, often for the purpose of increasing their future benefits or covering periods of low income or unemployment.

### Who needs it?
Any individual planning for retirement or who wants to ensure they have a sufficient pension fund, especially those who have periods in their employment history where they weren't able to contribute regularly.

## Procedure
1. Identify the appropriate body or organization (social security office, pension fund etc.) who accepts voluntary contributions in your country of residence.
2. Contact them either via their official website or physical office.
3. Request for the necessary forms or online process to apply for voluntary contributions.
4. Fill out the required forms accurately and provide all necessary documentation.
5. Submit the forms together with any required payment for the voluntary contribution.
6. Wait for confirmation of your application and maintain records of all transactions and correspondence.

## Required Documents
- Proof of identity (passport, ID card)
- Proof of income or earnings
- Details of previous contributions (if applicable)
- Bank account details for payments

## Additional details
Voluntary contributions can potentially increase your overall pension entitlement but they're also subject to certain rules and regulations. Engaging early with a pension advisor or a similar expert can offer personalised advice considering your specific situation.

Please note that actual steps and requirements can vary based on your locality and the specific rules of the pension system you contribute to. Always check with a relevant and trusted source before proceeding.
