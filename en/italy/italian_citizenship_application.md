Any person with Italian ancestry up to the 2nd generation, foreign residents who have been legally residing in Italy for 10 years, and spouses of Italian citizens, among others, can apply for Italian Citizenship.

3. Translate documents: All documents intended for use by the Italian authorities must be translated into Italian and validated by an official translator.
