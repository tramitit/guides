## Description
### What is it?
A medical certificate is a document issued by a healthcare provider verifying that an individual is physically fit to participate in a certain activity or event. In Italy, this can often include activities like running marathons, cycling races, and other athletic competitions.

### Who needs it?
Any individual planning to participate in an activity that requires proof of physical fitness or health status. This might include athletes, office workers required to produce it by the employers, or those planning to join fitness programs.

## Procedure
1. Book an appointment with a healthcare provider. This could be a general practitioner or a sports medicine specialist.
2. Attend the medical examination. This might include different tests like blood tests, heart-rate tests, and stress tests.
3. Once the tests are completed and the doctor deems fit, request them to issue a medical certificate certifying your capacity to carry out the intended activity. 
4. The doctor will then prepare and provide the medical certificate.

## Required Documents
- Personal Identification Document.
- Previous Medical Records: Any documents related to your medical history and health status.
- Examination Results: If examinations, like blood tests, were performed outside, please bring the results.
