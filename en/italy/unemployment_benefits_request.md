## Description
### What is it?
Unemployment benefits in Italy, also known as NASpI (Nuova Assicurazione Sociale per l'Impiego), is a type of payment made by the government to unemployed individuals who meet certain eligibility requirements.

### Who needs it?
This is especially designed for people who have lost their jobs and are currently seeking employment. 

## Procedure
1. Ensure you meet the criteria: You must have been employed and have contributed to INPS (Italian National Institute of Social Security) for at least 13 weeks in the 4 years preceding the start of unemployment, and must have worked for at least 30 days in the last 12 months.
2. Apply for NASpI: This must be done within 8 days after the last day of employment, or from the day the previous benefit stops. You can apply online by creating an account at [www.inps.it](http://www.inps.it).
3. Attend the summons from the Job Center: After you've submitted your application, you will receive a summons from the local job center (Centro per l'Impiego). You are obligated to attend these meetings.
4. Wait for approval: Your application will be reviewed by INPS. If approved, your benefits should start.

## Required Documents
- Dismissal letter from your last employer
- Unique certification (Certificazione Unica), which states the income you received in the last year
- Social Security Statement (CUD)
- Identification documents

## Additional details
Remember that during the time you receive the unemployment benefit, you must actively be looking for a job, and should you reject a job offer that matches your skills, you risk losing your benefits. NASpI is calculated on the basis of the average daily wage that you earned in the two years previous to your unemployment. The amount will be reduced after 4 months, and the duration of the payment varies depending on your age and contribution years.
