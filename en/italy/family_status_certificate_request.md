## Description
### What is it?
A Family Status Certificate or 'Stato di Famiglia' is a document issued by the Italian municipality where the person is a resident. It lists the names of the family members residing together, their relationship to each other and their birthdates.

### Who needs it?
Anyone who needs to provide evidence of their family status for various legal and administrative reasons, like applying for the citizenship, obtaining visas, or tracing ancestry, for example.

## Procedure

1. Identify the Commune (City Hall) of the city where your family resided in Italy.

2. Write a formal request for the Family Status Certificate. This should include the reason for your request, along with the names of the family members and their birthdates. 

3. Mail the letter to the commune's 'Anagrafe' office (Registry Office). In some cases, it might be possible to make a request online on the commune's official website.

4. You are likely to pay a fee, which will vary depending on the commune. Plan to pay for international postage if you're requesting from abroad.

5. The commune office will process your request and mail you the certificate. The processing time depends on the city and its particular procedures.

## Required Documents
- A written formal request with all necessary family details
- Payment for the certificate and postage, as required by the commune
