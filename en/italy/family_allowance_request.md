Family allowance is a state provision provided by the Italian government to eligible citizens, usually to support families with minors or families facing certain economic or social difficulties.

2. Fill out and submit the application form (modello ANF/DIP) to your employer if you're employed or directly to the INPS (Italian National Institute of Social Security) if you're retired or unemployed. Ensure to provide the required documents.

3. Once submitted, INPS will assess your eligibility and confirm if you qualify for the allowance and how much you will receive. The amount usually varies according to the size and economic condition of the family.

4. Upon confirmation, the payment will be made via the employer in case of employed individuals, directly to the beneficiary in case of pensioners, or through the Italian post office or a bank in the case of other categories of applicants.

## Additional details
It's crucial to update your data regularly with INPS, especially in the event of a change in your family condition like a new birth, a death, or a divorce. Payments are stopped if the child no longer resides in Italy, or in case of the death of the holder of the right. All updates will affect the amount of the benefit.
