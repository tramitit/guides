## Description
### What is it?
A death certificate is an official document issued by the government, stating the date, location, and cause of an individual's death.

### Who needs it?
Family members, genealogists, legal practitioners, or individuals involved in settlement of the deceased estate would need it. 

## Procedure
1. Gather all necessary information about the deceased, including their full name, date of birth, and date of death.
2. Write a formal letter of request in Italian. This letter should include all the relevant information about the deceased. 
3. Make sure to clearly state your relationship with the individual for whom you're requesting the death certificate. Also, specify why you need the certificate.
4. Send this letter to the 'comune' (town hall) of the place where the person died. You can find the contact information of the comunes [here](http://www.comuni-italiani.it/).
5. It's recommended to follow up your request with an email to the same comune. 
6. Wait for the response. The timeline varies depending on the comune.

## Required Documents
- Full name of the deceased along with date and place of birth.
- Date and place of death.
- Your relationship to the deceased, and the reason for your request.
