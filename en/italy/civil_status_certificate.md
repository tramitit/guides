## Description
### What is it?
A Civil Status Certificate is an official document that confirms a personâ€™s civil status - this could detail if they are single, married, divorced, or widowed. The certification may be required for various purposes, including marriage, visa application, inheritance procedures, and more.

### Who needs it?
Anyone who needs to provide certified evidence of their current civil status may need this certificate.
 
## Procedure
1. Prepare a written request, stating your complete name, date, and place of birth. 
2. In some cases, you may need to provide additional details like the names of your parents or the purpose of the certificate. 
3. Submit this request to the appropriate office in the town or city where you were born or where you reside.     
  
 ## Required Documents
The primary document required is a written request which you need to present to the local municipality. In some cases, a copy of your birth certificate might be required - this can be obtained through your local office or online through sites like [antecendi](https://www.anteceedinti.com).
