## Description
### What is it?
This service is about renewing your residence permit, is also known as Permesso di Soggiorno in Italy.

### Who needs it?
Anyone who is not an EU citizen and plans to stay in Italy for more than 90 days needs to apply for Permesso di Soggiorno. If you already have one but it's near expiry, you need to renew it.

## Procedure

1. Go to a post office and ask for the renewal kit, known as 'Kit di Rinnovo'.
2. Fill out the forms in the kit accordingly. 
3. Return the completed kit to the post office. They will give you a receipt with the date and time for your appointment ('appointment slip') at the immigration office (questura).
4. Attend your appointment at the questura. Make sure to bring all the required documents with you.
5. At the questura, they will take your fingerprints and photo, and you will have an interview.
6. If everything is fine, the questura will issue you a new Permesso di Soggiorno once it's ready. 

## Required Documents

The exact documents required may vary, but the most common ones include:

1. Your current/expired Permesso di Soggiorno.
2. Your passport.
3. Proof of sufficient financial resources.
4. Proof of housing, such as a rental contract.
5. Proof of enrollment if you're a student.

Please check with the local authorities for the exact list of required documents.

## Additional details

You must apply for the renewal before the expiry of your current residence permit. If you need to travel while waiting for the renewed permit, keep the appointment slip with you to show proof that you've applied for renewal. However, there may be restrictions on leaving Italy or Schengen Area during this period, as it depends on the country you're travelling to. Remember, this does not apply to all cases so it's always a good idea to check with the authorities before planning your travel.
