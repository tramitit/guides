## Description
### What is it?
The Military Service Completion Certificate is an official document that records an individual's discharge from active military duty. It's a historical document often required for genealogical research or citizenship by descent applications.

### Who needs it?
Primarily, those researching their family's history and individuals applying for citizenship by descent in Italy or Germany will need to access these documents.

## Procedure

1. Determine the relevant military district in Italy or Germany where the individual served or would have served.
2. For **Italy**, write a letter in Italian to the "Ufficio Leva" or "Conscription Office" of the State Archive in the province where your ancestor was born or resided.
