## Description
### What is it?
A building permit is a document required by the Italian law for anyone intending to undertake any building work. This involves modifications to existing structures, construction of new buildings, and other significant changes to the property.

### Who needs it?
Anyone planning to construct, extensively remodel, or alter the use of a property in Italy, regardless if they are locals or foreigners, needs to apply for this permit. 

## Procedure
1. Define your project: Determine the kind of construction or modifications you intend to carry out on your property. This will set the direction for the legal and bureaucratic processes to follow. 

2. Consult an architect: Hire a professional architect to advise on the project and ensure it complies with the local laws and codes. 

3. Prepare a project plan: The architect prepares the blueprints and all necessary documentation detailing every aspect of the project.

4. Application package: Once your plan is ready, submit it to your local municipality for approval. The package will include various documents and fees for your application. 

5. Evaluation: The local municipality thoroughly evaluates your plan. This process can take several weeks or even months depending on the size and complexity of your project.

6. Obtain the permit: The building permit is granted once the project is approved by the local municipality. Only then, you may commence your project.

## Required Documents
- A detailed plan of the construction project designed by a licensed architect.
- Certificate of land ownership.
- Declaration of consent from your immediate neighbours.
- Payment of application fees.
- Technical report from the architect, certifying that the project adheres to the municipal standards.
