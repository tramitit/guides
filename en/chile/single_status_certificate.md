## Description
### What is it?
A Single Status Certificate, also known as a Certificate of No Impediment, is a document that proves an individual is legally eligible to marry in Chile. This certificate is crucial for foreigners planning to get married in Chile, as it confirms that they are not currently married or bound by any legal marital status in their home country.

### Who needs it?
This service is ideal for individuals, particularly foreigners, who are planning to get married in Chile. It is also essential for those who may need to present proof of their single status for various legal, immigration, or personal purposes.

## Procedure

1. Obtain a confirmation of your single status from your home country, often available from local municipal or registry offices.
2. Have the document legalized or apostilled as per the requirements of your home country (useful resources: [Venezuelan document apostille guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/vzla/wiki/tramites/legalizaciondocumentoscivilesapostilla/)).
3. Translate the document into Spanish by an authorized translator if it is not already in Spanish.
4. Submit the translated document to Chilean authorities, such as the Civil Registry and Identification Service (Registro Civil e Identificaci√≥n).
5. Await verification and issuance of the Single Status Certificate by Chilean authorities.
