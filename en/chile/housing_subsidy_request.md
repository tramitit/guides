## Description
### What is it?
The Housing Subsidy Request service in Chile provides financial assistance to eligible individuals and families to help them purchase their own homes. This government initiative aims to make homeownership more accessible to a wider range of people by providing subsidies that reduce the overall cost of purchasing a property.

### Who needs it?
This service is ideal for Chilean citizens and permanent residents who have a stable income but need additional financial support to afford a home. It is especially beneficial for young families, first-time homebuyers, and middle-income earners struggling with the high cost of real estate. Applicants should have a consistent credit history and be ready to provide the necessary documentation to qualify for the subsidy.

## Procedure

1. Check your eligibility based on income and family size criteria on the official Chilean government housing website.
2. Gather all required documents, including proof of income, ID, and residency, and ensure they are up to date.
3. Complete the Housing Subsidy application form available online or at the local government office.
4. Submit your completed application along with the required documents to the designated department.
5. Attend any required interviews or inspections scheduled by the housing authorities.
6. Await the review and approval of your application, and respond promptly to any additional information requests.
7. Upon approval, follow the guidelines provided to receive your subsidy and proceed with purchasing your home.
