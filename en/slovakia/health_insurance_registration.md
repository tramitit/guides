## Additional details
In many cases, your employer will register you for health insurance. If you're a student, your university may register you. If you are unemployed or self-employed, you ought to do it yourself. You need to make sure that you are registered within 8 days of starting work or becoming a resident. Failure to do so may result in a fine or denial of services.
Health services in Slovakia are not free of charge and you may be required to co-pay for some services. However, basic healthcare services are covered by insurance.
