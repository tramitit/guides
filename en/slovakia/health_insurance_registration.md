Every foreign national who is employed, self-employed, studying, or living in Slovakia is required to have health insurance.

## Procedure
1. Obtain a residence permit if you plan to stay in Slovakia for more than 90 days.

3. Present necessary documents and fill out an application form. Depending on your status (student, employed, self-employed, etc.), you might need additional documents.
4. Once approved, you will receive confirmation of your health insurance registration.

## Additional details
In many cases, your employer will register you for health insurance. If you're a student, your university may register you. If you are unemployed or self-employed, you ought to do it yourself. You need to make sure that you are registered within 8 days of starting work or becoming a resident. Failure to do so may result in a fine or denial of services.
Health services in Slovakia are not free of charge and you may be required to co-pay for some services. However, basic healthcare services are covered by insurance.
