## Description
### What is it?
The cancellation of permanent residence refers to the process of formally terminating your status as a permanent resident in a country in which you currently live. This is usually required when you plan to move to another country or revert to a tourist or temporary status in the current country.

### Who needs it?
This procedure is often necessary for expatriates, immigrants or long-term residents who seek to alter their immigration status, relocate permanently to another country, or for individuals who no longer wish to maintain their permanent resident status in their current country.

## Procedure
While the procedure can vary slightly depending on the country, the steps outlined below are generally required:

1. Contact the immigration office: To begin the process, get in touch with the immigration authorities in your country of residence. This might be known as the Department of Immigration, Immigration Services or a similar name.

2. Review the requirements: Each country generally has a form or an application process to cancel your permanent residence status. Make sure to thoroughly understand the requirements.

3. Prepare the necessary documents: This often includes proof of your permanent residence (like your residency card), passport, or other identification documents.

4. Submit your application: Once you've gathered the required documents, submit your application to the appropriate department. This can often be done online, by post, or in person.

5. Wait for confirmation: The authorities will process your application and then send you a confirmation, indicating that your permanent residence status has been cancelled.

## Required Documents
To cancel your permanent residence, you generally need:

- Proof of your permanent residence (usually your residency card)
- Valid passport or other identification documents
- Documents supporting your reasons for canceling permanent residence, if necessary

## Additional details
Keep in mind that once you cancel your permanent residence status, you may lose certain rights and benefits in the given country. It's also crucial to bear in mind that not every country allows for a direct cancellation of a permanent residence. Depending on the country's regulations, you may have to first change your status to a temporary resident or leave the country altogether. Always check with immigration officials to make sure you understand the laws and regulations in your particular situation. While the procedure can vary depending on the country in question, the aforementioned steps provide a general guide to what you can expect. Professional assistance is always beneficial in such circumstances.
