## Description
### What is it?
The exchange of a foreign driver's license involves converting a driving license obtained in one country to another's equivalent, enabling the holder to drive in a different nation without undergoing the comprehensive testing process.
### Who needs it?
Anyone planning to drive in a different country for extended periods, such as expats, long-term travelers, or international students, might need to exchange their foreign driver's license according to the host country's regulations.

## Procedure
1. Verify the equivalence or reciprocal agreement between the countries involved.
2. Register with the local registration authority.
3. Submit the required documents, including your original driving license.
4. Take the vision test if required.
5. Pay the necessary fees.
6. Once approved, you'll receive your new driving license.

## Required Documents
- Original valid driving license
- Identification document (passport)
- Proof of registration in the host country
- Recent passport-sized photographs.

Please note: the required documents can vary depending on the specific procedures of the host country.
