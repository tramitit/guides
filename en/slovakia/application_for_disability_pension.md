## Description
### What is it?
A disability pension is a form of pension given to those who are prevented from working due to injury or illness. It is meant to provide income during the time when an individual is unable to work.

### Who needs it?
Anyone who is unable to work because of a noticeable and severe long-term disability, and has contributed to the pension scheme while they were working.

## Procedure
1. Get a medical certificate from your doctor. The certificate must confirm that due to your health condition you are unable to work.
2. Apply for a disability pension at your local social security office. The application must be submitted in writing and must be signed by the applicant or his/her authorized representative.
3. The social security office will process your application and decide whether you meet the criteria for a disability pension. Your application will be checked by a social security medical commission.
4. Once your application is approved, you will start receiving your pension. The amount will be determined based on your previous income and years of insurance.

## Required Documents
- Medical certificate
- Application form for a disability pension
- Proof of previous income (e.g., pay slips)
- Proof of years of insurance contribution

## Additional details
It's important to note that the provision of a disability pension is primarily based on the nature of the individual's disability and not on their ability to work. Therefore, it is crucial that the medical certificate adequately documents the health condition of the individual. Similarly, anyone seeking a disability pension should ensure their insurance contributions are up-to-date, as this may affect the approval and amount of their pension.
