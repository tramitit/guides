## Description
### What is it?
An International Driver's Permit is a document that allows individuals with a valid driver's license from their native country to drive in foreign countries that are a part of the 1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic.
### Who needs it?
Any individual planning to drive in a foreign country(like Slovakia) who is not a holder of a driving license from EU or EEA countries needs an IDP.

## Procedure
1. Confirm your eligibility: You should be at least 18 years old and possess a valid driver's license from your home country.
2. Start the application process for International Driver's License with a recognized authority in your country. For instance, in the US, you could use AAA ([American Automobile Association](https://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html)) or [AATA](https://aataidp.com/) (American Automobile Touring Alliance). 
3. Fill in the required forms detailing necessary personal information. With AAA, you can [download the application form](https://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpapplcations.html) directly from their website.
4. Provide two passport-size photos along with your application. These photos can be taken at any local post office or photo studio.
5. Include a photocopy of both sides of your current driver’s license.
6. Pay the necessary fee. The cost of an IDP with AAA, for instance, is $20.

## Required Documents
- Valid Driver's License
- Passport size photos (2)
- Copy of current driver’s license

## Additional details
- The International Driver's License is not a standalone document and should be carried alongside your original driver's license.
- It's valid for one year from the issue date.
- Understand that it's a translation of your existing license and does not bestow extra driving privileges. Keep in mind the driving rules of the country you are visiting.
