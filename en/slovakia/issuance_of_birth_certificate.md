## Description
### What is it?
A birth certificate is an official document issued by the Registry Office in Slovakia, which certifies the birth of an individual. It contains essential details such as the date of birth, place of birth, and parentage.

### Who needs it?
Slovakian citizens, living both in Slovakia and abroad, may require their birth certificate to prove their age, nationality, or parentage for various legal and administrative procedures.

## Procedure

1. Application: Applicants need to make a written request to the Registry Office in the municipality where the birth occurred.
2. Document Submission: Along with the application, the required documents should be submitted.
3. Fee Payment: Pay the applicable fees needed to cover administrative costs.
4. Certificate Issuance: Upon successful verification, the Registry Office issues the birth certificate.

## Required Documents

- Proof of Identity (such as a passport or ID card)
- Proof of Residency (for Slovak citizens living abroad)

Note: Any foreign documents submitted must be translated into Slovak by an official translator.
