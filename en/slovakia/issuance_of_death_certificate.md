## Description
### What is it?
The issuance of a death certificate is a formal process by which an individual's death is officially documented. This is done in the form of a legal document stating the date, location, and cause of the individual's death.

### Who needs it?
This is a required document for all individuals following a family member or close relative's passing. It's often necessary for legal and administrative processes, including the execution of a will, accessing pensions or insurance benefits, and other financial matters.

## Procedure
1. The first step is to obtain and fill out the application form for a death certificate. This can usually be obtained from a local civil registry office or from your relevant national government's website.
2. The application form needs to be submitted along with the relevant supporting documentation. This typically includes an official notification of death from a healthcare provider and proof of relationship to the deceased (for example, a marriage or birth certificate).
3. Submit the application to the appropriate government office. This may be a local or national office depending on your country's regulations.
4. There may be a processing fee to be paid at the time of application.
5. Wait for the application to be processed and for the death certificate to be issued. This will be mailed to the address provided on the application form.
6. Once received, store the death certificate safely, as it is an important legal document.

## Required Documents
-Notification of death from a recognized healthcare provider
-Proof of relationship to the deceased (i.e. Birth certificate, Marriage certificate)
-Completed application form

## Additional details
It's important to make several copies of the death certificate once it has been issued. These may be needed for separate legal and administrative procedures. Also, be aware that not everyone can request a death certificate; you usually must be closely related to the person who passed away. Some governments provide multilingual death certificates, which may be necessary if you're going to be presenting the document in a country where the issuing government's official language isn't spoken.
