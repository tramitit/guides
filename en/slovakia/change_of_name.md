## Description
### What is it?
A name change refers to the legal action allowing any individual to adopt a name different from their name of birth, marriage, or adoption. In Slovakia, the process involves legal requirements and documentation.

### Who needs it?
This process is significant for people who wish to change their first name, surname, or even add a middle name for any personal, cultural, or lifestyle reasons.

## Procedure

1. You would need to contact your local Registry Office (Matrika) where you were born in Slovakia. The process starts there. 

2. Prepare your documents for submission. This includes the current and valid identification documents, birth certificates, marriage certificates (if applicable), and any other required documents.

3. Submit an application for a name change. You should state the specific reasons for wanting a name change. Realize that this process can be personal and may involve elaborating on personal details. 

4. Pay the required fees associated with the application. The exact amount varies depending on the specific municipality in Slovakia.

5. Wait for approval. It is important to remember that approval isn't guaranteed and is subject to the discretion of the local authorities based on the reasons in your application and documents provided.

6. If approved, you'll receive a certificate stating your new name. From then, you are free to use your new name, and you should make sure to change it on all of your personal documents, IDs, bank accounts, etc.

## Required Documents
- Current and valid identification documents
- Birth certificate
- Marriage certificate (if applicable)
