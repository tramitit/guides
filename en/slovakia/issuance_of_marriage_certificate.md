## Description
### What is it?
A Marriage Certificate is an official document that legally recognizes two individuals as a married couple. In Slovakia, this document is issued by the local civil registry office (Matričný úrad).

### Who needs it?
Anyone who has gotten married in Slovakia or Slovakian citizens married abroad who need an official proof of their marriage status.

## Procedure
1. Contact the local civil registry office (Matričný úrad) relevant to your location. To find the appropriate civil registry office, follow this link: [Civil Registry Offices in Slovakia](https://www.slovensko.sk/sk/contacts/).
2. Apply for the marriage certificate in person. Both husband and wife should be present for the application.
3. Submit all necessary documents needed for the issuance of the marriage certificate.
4. The civil registry office will then process your application.
5. Pick up the marriage certificate once it is ready. Usually, you'll be notified when your certificate is ready for pickup.

The documents required for issuance of a marriage certificate in Slovakia include:
- Proof of Identity (Passport, ID Card)
