## Description
### What is it?
The notification of a child's birth is a process where you officially register your newborn child with the relevant local authorities. This is important for the child to be recognized legally and to be granted nationality, particularly in immigration situations.

### Who needs it?
This service is mandatory for anyone who has had a child, regardless of their nationality or location.

## Procedure
1. The process starts in the hospital, where you will be provided with a certificate of birth from the attending doctor or midwife.
2. Fill up the birth certificate correctly, ensuring all details including the child's name and the parents' details are accurately captured.
3. Take the birth certificate to the local registration office for your area.
4. Submit the birth certificate to the local registrar, and make sure you have all the required documents needed for this process.
5. The registrar will review the submitted documents. Once everything is confirmed to be in order, the birth is officially registered. 

## Required Documents
- Certificate of birth provided by the hospital
- Identity documents of both parents such as ID cards, passports, or driverâ€™s licenses
- For immigrants, proof of legal status in the country may be required, such as a visa or permanent resident card.

Ensure the child's name meets local regulations. Some countries have laws governing how a child can be named, so it's best to be familiar with those rules before finalizing your child's name.
