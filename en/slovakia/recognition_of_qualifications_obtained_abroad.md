## Description
### What is it?
Recognition of qualifications obtained abroad involves the verification and assessment of academic and professional qualifications earned in a foreign country to ensure they meet the standards of another country. This is crucial for those wanting to continue their studies, or to work in a profession that requires certain educational standards.

### Who needs it?
This service is crucial for students wanting to further their studies in foreign countries or professionals looking to work abroad. 

## Procedure
1. Identify the country where you want your qualifications to be recognized and find out their specific process for managing international qualifications.
2. Contact the regulatory body or professional association in that country for inquiries. They often have the authoritative power to recognize foreign qualifications. 
3. Submit the necessary documentation required for assessment. 
4. Pay any applicable fees that may be required for your application process.
5. Await the assessment of your qualifications - the duration of this will depend on the country and institution you are applying to.
6. Once the evaluation has been made, you'll receive a recognition statement, which might indicate equivalency to a certain level or degree in the country of evaluation. 

## Required Documents
Below are commonly requested documents. Always refer to the specific requirements of your chosen country or institution:

- Original qualification documents (Certificates/Diplomas)
- Transcripts 
- Translation of qualification documents (if required)
- Certified copies of your identification
- Proof of payment for assessment fee (if required)

## Additional details
While the general processes for recognition of qualifications are alike, specific processes can differ greatly depending on the country. As such, always ascertain the specific requirements from relevant professional organizations or regulatory bodies in the country where you intend to use the qualifications. 

Keep up to date with changes to these regulations due to Brexit or the COVID-19 pandemic, as stipulated by the relevant regulatory bodies. 

Plan ahead: this process may take several weeks or even months, depending on the country and the qualification. 

Some countries do not directly recognize foreign qualifications but rather allow you to sit for a local examination or accreditation program. It's important to know what options are available in your destination country.
