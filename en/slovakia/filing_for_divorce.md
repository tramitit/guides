## Description
### What is it?
Filing for divorce is a legal procedure that ends a marriage. It involves numerous steps, including arranging for legal representation, gathering necessary documents, filing for divorce with a court, and potentially attending court hearings.

### Who needs it?
Anyone who is married and wants to legally end their marriage.

## Procedure
1. Consult an attorney. They will guide you through the legal process and can represent you in court proceedings.
2. Gather all necessary information and documents about your marriage and assets. This may include the date of the marriage, addresses, names of children, and property/assets details.
3. File a summons and complaint with the appropriate court. These are legal documents that start the divorce process and outline your desires for property division, child custody, etc.
4. Send a copy of the summons and complaint to your spouse.
5. Await your spouse's response to the summons and complaint.
6. If you and your spouse can agree on all terms, you may complete a settlement agreement and present it to the court. If you cannot agree, you will need to attend further court proceedings to resolve the disagreements.
7. Attend a hearing where the judge will finalize the divorce and issue a final divorce decree.
