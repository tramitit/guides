## Description
### What is it?
Vehicle registration, in context of Poland, is a mandatory process for documentation and legalisation of a vehicle right after its purchase or import into the country. Through this process, the vehicle gets assigned a unique registration number that is used for identification purposes.

### Who needs it?
Anyone who has recently purchased or imported a car, motorcycle, scooter etc. into Poland needs to register it. Also, individuals shifting their residence to Poland along with their vehicle need to register it within the specified time frame.

## Procedure
1. The very first step is to obtain the car documentation. This includes the original vehicle registration documents and purchase invoice. If the vehicle is purchased from a country other than Poland, make sure you have documents that clearly state EU compliance.
2. Get insurance for your vehicle. This is mandatory before you can start the registration process. Poland has numerous insurance companies to choose from.
3. Collect the necessary documents: registration documents of the vehicle, proof of purchase, insurance papers, ID proof and a filled application form for vehicle registration.
4. Submit the required documents to the 'Powiatowy Wydzia≈Ç Komunikacji' in the city of your residence. Fees for registration will need to be paid. The fees can vary depending on the type and age of the vehicle.
5. You will need to wait for a few days for your application to be processed. Once approved, you will receive your vehicle registration certificate and plates.

## Required Documents
- Original Vehicle Registration Documents
- Vehicle Purchase Invoice
