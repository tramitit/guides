## Description
### What is it?
Unemployment benefit is a social security measure that provides temporary financial assistance to unemployed individuals who are actively seeking employment. 

### Who needs it?
This service is essential for anyone who has lost their job and is currently looking for a new one. It can act as a financial buffer during the job-hunting process.

## Procedure

1. Register as unemployed at your local labor office (Powiatowy UrzÄ…d Pracy or PUP).
2. Check your eligibility for unemployment benefits. This depends on several factors, including your insurance period and the reason for losing your job.

## Required Documents

- Personal identification (ID or Passport).
- Record of Employment (to prove that you were previously employed and have lost your job).
- Any other documents indicating the reasons for termination of your employment.

## Additional details
- It's important to note that the amount of unemployment benefit you are eligible to receive depends on your previous earnings.
- If you have been employed on a B2B (business-to-business) contract in Poland, be aware that this might affect your eligibility for unemployment benefits.
- Be sure to maintain your health insurance even during your unemployment period. If you are an EU citizen, you might be eligible for health insurance despite being unemployed.
- It's advisable to stay updated with the current unemployment rates in Europe and Poland specifically, as these might affect the policies related to unemployment benefits.
