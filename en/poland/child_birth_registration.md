## Description
### What is it?
Child birth registration is a crucial process that legally recognizes a child as an individual under the state law. It ensures a child's right to nationality, health care, education and other social services.

### Who needs it?
This process is essential for new parents or legal guardians who have recently had a child in Poland. Other individuals who may need to understand this process are those involved in infant care, such as health care workers, adoption agencies, and social workers.

## Procedure

1. Register the child's birth at the local Civil Registry Office (USC) within 21 days of the birth. You need to provide a medical certificate confirming the birth of the child issued by a doctor or a midwife.
2. If the child was born outside of a medical facility (home birth), notify the local district health department within 24 hours. A doctor or a midwife will then provide a medical certificate confirming the childâ€™s birth.
3. After the above processes are completed, you will receive a Polish birth certificate.

## Required Documents
The following documents are needed for the registration:

- Medical certificate confirming the birth of the child. 
- Parents' ID or passport
- If the parents are married, marriage certificate. Else, a declaration acknowledging paternity is required.

## Additional details
It is important to notify the local USC within 21 days of the birth. Failing to do so may lead to administrative or legal consequences. Remember to also register your child's birth in your home country's embassy or consulate if you are not a resident in Poland. In some cases, simultaneous registration in both Poland and your home country might be required or beneficial. It's recommended to verify this with your local embassy. 

If the parents are unmarried, the father must be present at the USC to acknowledge paternity. If the father is unable to be present, he can provide a written acknowledgement that is confirmed by a notary. 

Remember to request for an International Birth Certificate as it is written in multiple languages, making it easier to use abroad. This process might slightly differ depending on the city in Poland. It's recommended to contact your local USC for specific details.
