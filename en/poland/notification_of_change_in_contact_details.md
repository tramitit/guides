## Description
### What is it?
A procedure to update your contact details (postal address, email, phone number) in various online and offline entities including social media platforms, banks, utilities and government agencies, etc.

### Who needs it?
People who are changing their contact details due to reasons like relocation, security concerns or others. 

## Procedure
1. Identify the services/entities you are associated with, that need to be notified.
2. Log into each service's website or app, and then look for 'settings' or 'profile' or 'account' option.
3. In the settings, find option to update contact details.
4. Input new contact details and save changes.
5. For offline entities, you may need to visit their office for update or send a formal letter to notify about the changes. 

(N.B: The exact steps may vary depending on each provider)

## Required Documents
1. Proof of new contact details (e.g., utility bill for new address, new phone number's receipt, etc.)
2. Identity proof (may not be required everywhere)

## Providers that can do it for you (example)

| Provider        |     Website     |     Timelines    |       Cost      |
| --------------- | --------------- |  :-------------: | :-------------: |
| Official Mail Forwarding Service      |  www.usps.com       |      7-10 days      |        $1.05       |

## Additional details
Consider changing your contact details in the following entities for smooth communication:
- Social Media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc.
- Banks
- Utilities services (Water/Electricity/Gas)
- Subscriptions (Magazines/Newsletters/Online Services)
- Government entities (DMV, IRS, USPS for forwarding mails, etc.)
- Email providers
In case of Facebook Messenger, you may have to sync contacts and restart your device if notifications show up in the wrong account after changing the phone number. The steps can be different for Android and iPhone. 
You should also update your details in different phone services, for example, for Poco X3 users, in MI cloud settings, do a sync after updating the details. If there is a delay, make sure your software updates are in place.
It's better to update your new address immediately after you move to a new place. It might be troublesome if there is much delay, for example in Japan, you should report an address change to the ward or city office within 14 days of moving.
