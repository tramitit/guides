## Description
### What is it?
A gun permit or firearm license is a legal document that allows an individual to purchase, carry, or use firearms in Poland. 

### Who needs it?
Anyone intending to legally own, purchase, or carry a firearm in Poland would require a firearm permit. This ranges from sport shooters, hunters, to individuals who need firearms for self-defence, collecting or historical reenactment.

## Procedure
1. Begin by obtaining a qualifying reason for owning a firearm such as being a hunter, sports shooter, collector, or having a demonstrable threat against your life.
2. Enroll in a firearm safety course that includes both theoretical (eg. legal issues) and practical (eg. handling firearms) parts.
3. After successful completion of the safety course, apply for a psychiatric evaluation. This consists of a written questionnaire followed by a meeting with a psychiatrist.
4. Acquire a document proving a lack of criminal record from the National Criminal Register (Krajowy Rejestr Karny - KRK).
5. Apply for a firearm license at the local police station along with documents such as ID, payment receipt, certificate of completion of safety course, psychiatric evaluation result and crime record statement.
6. Wait for the decision which may take up to 3 months.

## Required Documents
- ID Card
- Document proving a qualifying reason for owning a firearm
- Certificate of completion of the safety course
- Results of psychiatric evaluation
- National Criminal Register (Krajowy Rejestr Karny - KRK) record statement

## Additional details
Carrying a concealed firearm in public is allowed only for self-defence license holders.
Remember to renew your license as it is valid for a limited time only â€“ 1 year for self-defence, 5 years for sport shooting, and 10 years for hunting and collections. Acquiring ammunition requires a separate permit.
