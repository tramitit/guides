## Description
### What is it?
A reporting copyright infringement is a formal complaint made when someone uses a copyright-protected work without the necessary permission. Such complaints can be made on Reddit when someone believes their copyrighted work is being unlawfully used or shared on the platform.

### Who needs it?
The ideal user for this service is anyone who owns copyright to the particular work (like a post, comment, image, or video etc.) which has been reproduced, distributed, performed, publicly displayed, or made into a derivative work without their permission.

## Procedure

1. Gather information about the infringing material and the subreddit where it is posted.
2. To file a report over a copyright infringement with Reddit, you need to contact Reddit's designated agent under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). 
3. You can do so by sending them an email to contact@reddit.com or a mail to Reddit's copyright agent at Reddit, Inc., 420 Taylor St. San Francisco, CA 94102.
4. In your report, you should provide the following information [as per the DMCA](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512):
   - Identify the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.
   - Identify the material that is claimed to be infringing and information reasonably sufficient to locate that material.
   - Provide your contact information such as address, telephone number, and, email address.
   - State that you believe in good faith that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
   - Include a statement that the information contained in the notice is accurate and under the penalty of perjury, you are the owner or authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
5. Itâ€™s important to be aware that filing a false report can result in legal and financial penalties.

## Required Documents
The required 'documents' are essentially elements you need to include in your report:
- Description and location of the infringing material.
- Your contact information.
- A statement of good faith belief.
- A statement that the information is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, you are the copyright owner or are authorized on behalf of one.
