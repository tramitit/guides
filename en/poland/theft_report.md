## Description
### What is it?
A theft report is a formal statement made with the purpose of notifying the relevant authorities or stakeholders of an incident of theft. This can include anything from personal property to credit card information.

### Who needs it?
Any individual who has experienced theft in Poland, either as a victim or a witness, may need to file a theft report.

## Procedure

1. Immediately after noticing the theft, contact the police. In Poland, you can call 112 for general emergencies or 997 for police emergenies.
2. Visit the nearest police station to file a formal report. Make sure to provide a detailed description of the incident and the stolen item(s). 
3. For credit card theft, contact your credit card issuer as soon as you notice your card is missing or your card information has been stolen. In many cases, this can be done online or over the phone.
