## Description
### What is it?
An ID Card in Poland is also known as a 'Dowod Osobisty.' This official identification document is not only used for verifying identification but also for signing documents electronically and performing other administrative tasks.

Any Polish citizen above the age of 18 is required to have an ID Card. Moreover, foreigners who are permanent residents in Poland can also apply for a Dowod Osobisty.

## Procedure
1. Fill out an application for a Dowod Osobisty, which can be obtained from your local city council office.
2. Submit the following required documents at your local city council's office where they will verify the authenticity of your documents.
3. You will receive confirmation that your application has been accepted and the timeline within which your ID should be ready for pick-up.
4. After the indicated time has passed, return to the office to get your ID Card.
