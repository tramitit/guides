## Description
### What is it?
A change of registration certificate is a process required when one needs to modify the information on their existing vehicle registration documents. This could be due to relocation, a change in ownership, or substantial alterations to the vehicle, among other reasons.

### Who needs it?
The process is necessary for anyone living in Poland who has relocated within the country, sold or purchased a car, got married and changed their surname, or made significant changes to their vehicle that must be recorded in their official registration documents.

## Procedure
1. Visit your local municipal (gmina) office. 
2. Complete the necessary paperwork including the change of personal details form. 
3. Submit your existing vehicle registration documents. 
4. Provide proof of your new address, if applicable. 
5. Pay the necessary fees.

## Required Documents

Also, fees can vary depending on the nature of your change. For example, a straightforward address change may cost less than a change due to significant vehicle alterations.
