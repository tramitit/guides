## Description
### What is it?
A work permit is a document that authorizes a foreigner to work legally in Poland.
### Who needs it?
Any non-European Union citizen who wants to work in Poland needs a work permit, and the permit must be processed by the prospective employer.

## Procedure
1. Find a job in Poland. The work permit is issued to the request of the employer.
2. The employer initiates the application for the work permit for his prospective employee. 
3. The application is submitted to the relevant Voivodship Office (https://www.gov.pl/) in Poland.
4. Once the application is approved, a copy of the decision is sent to the employer and another one to the prospective foreign employee. 

## Required Documents
The following documents are generally needed:

1. An application form completed by the employer, detailing the position and the terms of employment.
2. Proof of legal entry and stay within Poland.

## Additional details
Note that non-EU residents can only work in Poland if they hold a work permit and the employer starts the process. The duration of this permit is usually tied to the duration of the respective employment agreement, however, it does not exceed 3 years and can be extended. 

The exact list of documents required and the application process can vary depending on the specific type of work permit being applied for, and each Voivodship office may have its own specific requirements. Thus, it is important to check with the relevant office for complete and accurate information.
