## Description
### What is it?
The change of surname notification is the legal process through which an individual notifies the appropriate authorities of his/her decision to use a new surname.

### Who needs it?
This service is needed by anyone who has legally changed their surname due to personal wish, marriage, divorce, or any other valid reason in Poland.

## Procedure
1. Obtain a legal document to justify the name change. This could be a marriage certificate, divorce decree, or personal statement.

2. Notify the local Polish office (`Urząd gminy`) about the change. This office is responsible for any legal changes linked to personal status, including change of surname.

3. Update your ID card (`Dowód osobisty`). You can apply for a new card at the same `Urząd gminy`. 

4. Notify additional entities of the name change. Any bank accounts, subscriptions, memberships, or other services in your name will need to be updated.

## Required Documents
1. Legal document granting the name change
2. Old ID card
3. Completed application form for a new ID card

**How to Obtain the Document:**
The legal document granting the name change can be provided by the legal entity effecting the change like a court in case of personal wish, or a civil State Registrar in case of marital status change.
