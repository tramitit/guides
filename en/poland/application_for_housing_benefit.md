## Description
### What is it?
Housing Benefit is a social security benefit administered by local councils in the UK to help eligible individuals cover part of their rental costs.

### Who needs it?
The benefit is particularly useful for people who are unemployed, on a low income, or in receipt of other benefits. However, it's predominantly being replaced by Universal Credit.

## Procedure
1. Determine your eligibility for Housing Benefit. However, note that Housing Benefit is being replaced by Universal Credit, so you may need to apply for that instead.
2. To apply, visit the [official website](https://www.gov.uk/housing-benefit/how-to-claim).
3. Fill in the application form completely. Include all personal details, income information, and housing costs.
4. Submit the form for processing. You can send this by post or in some cases, apply online.
5. Wait for the local council to decide on your application. You'll receive a notification once your application has been processed.

## Required Documents
- Proof of identity (passport, national identity card, driving license)
- Proof of rent (rent agreement, letter from landlord)
- Proof of income (payslips, bank statements)
- Benefits certificates
