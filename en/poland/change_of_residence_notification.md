## Description

### What is it?
A change of residence notification is a formal procedure that the citizens and residents of Poland must perform when they change their place of residence. The notification is crucial to update the country's national registry (including the PESEL number - Poland's national identification number system) and other public records.

### Who needs it?
The service is mandatory for anyone currently living in Poland – whether Polish citizens or residents, including foreigners – who have changed their places of residence.

## Procedure

1. Upon moving to a new residence, you have 14 days to report the change at the local (Urząd Gminy) or City Office (Urząd Miasta). 

2. You need to fill out a residence registration form. This form is commonly referred to as Zgłoszenie zamieszkania na pobyt stały. The forms can be obtained at the office itself or can be found online on local administrative websites of Poland.

3. Once the form is filled out correctly, you need to submit it at the office along with the necessary documents.

## Required Documents

1. An identity card specifically for Polish citizens 

2. A passport especially for foreigners

3. Housing agreement – may be an ownership document, rental agreement, certificate of title, or letter from the landlord confirming the right to live in the place of residence.
