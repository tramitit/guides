## Description

### What is it?
A residence permit, locally known as Karta Pobytu, is a document granting permission to foreign nationals to stay in Poland legally beyond the duration of their visa or visa-free stay. Holders of this permit can also open a bank account in Poland.

### Who needs it?
Non-European Union citizens who plan to reside, work or study in Poland for a duration exceeding 90 days in a 180-day period need a residence permit. 

## Procedure 

1. Gather all the required documents for application.
2. Submit the application to the Voivode competent for the place of your stay.
3. Upon receiving your submission, the Voivode will invite you to complete the application.
4. After submitting the application, you will receive a stamp in your passport as a proof that you're in the process of obtaining the permit.
5. Lastly, the Voivode's office will make the decision within a few weeks' time. 

## Required Documents
