## Description
### What is it?
VAT (Value-Added Tax) refund is a percentage of the VAT that you paid for goods that you bought within the EU. As a non-EU resident, you are entitled to claim a VAT refund generally from many EU countries, including Poland. Note that digital services are usually not eligible for a VAT refund.

### Who needs it?
Non-EU residents who make retail purchases within the EU can apply to have the VAT that they have been charged refunded, providing they intend to take purchased goods out of the EU.

## Procedure
1. Make your purchase in any store. Ask the shop for a VAT refund form and ensure that the shop provides you with this.
2. Fill in the form with your details. Make sure to have your passport with you, as you'll often need to provide your passport number.
3. When leaving the EU, present this form along with your purchased goods, receipts, and your passport at the customs office at the point of departure for a stamp.
4. Once you get the customs stamp, you can return the VAT refund form to the shop, either directly or using the services of a VAT refund company as provided by the shop. This could be through a stamped envelope or via email.
5. Upon receipt of the stamped VAT form, the shop or VAT refund company then initiates the refund process. The refund can be done either through a deductible refund when you're still in the EU, or afterwards directly to your bank account or credit card, depending on the provider's refund method.

## Required Documents
- VAT refund form (provided by the shop where the goods were purchased)
- Original receipts from the purchases
- Passport for verification

## Additional details
It's worth noting that not all goods are eligible for a VAT refund. Certain expenses like hotel accommodation or restaurant meals are typically not included. The refund might take some time to process (up to several weeks), so plan accordingly. Additionally, some stores may not participate in VAT refund schemes, and some may have a minimum purchase amount to qualify, so it's always best to ask before you make a purchase.
