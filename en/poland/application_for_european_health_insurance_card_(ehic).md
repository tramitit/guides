## Description
### What is it?
The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) is an initiative by EU countries that provides the cardholder with access to state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another EU country. It covers treatment that is medically necessary until the cardholder return to their home country.

### Who needs it?
The EHIC is important for all residents of EU countries who intend to travel to another EU country, either for vacation, work, study, or any temporary period.

## Procedure
1. Visit the official website according to your EU home country.
2. Fill up the application form with all necessary information.
3. Submit the application form.
4. Upon receiving approval for your application, the EHIC card will be delivered to your address.
5. Always remember to carry EHIC with you when traveling to EU countries.

## Required Documents
A list of valid Identification and residency documents might be needed based on the country of application. Typically the following are required:
1. Valid Passport
2. Proof of residency in the home country

Here are the official websites to apply for EHIC based on your home country:

- [Health Service Executive (HSE) for Ireland citizens](https://www2.hse.ie/services/ehic/ehic.html)

## Additional details
Remember that the EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance. It does not cover any private healthcare or costs such as a return flight to your home country or lost/stolen property. Therefore, it is advisable to have both an EHIC and a valid private travel insurance policy.

For UK residents, post-Brexit, the GHIC (Global Health Insurance Card) replaces the EHIC. UK issued EHICs are still valid until their expiry date. But the new applicants from the UK will receive GHIC instead of EHIC. GHIC provides the same benefits as EHIC.
