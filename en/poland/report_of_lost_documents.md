## Description
### What is it?
This guide is the procedure on how to report and get replacement of lost documents, such as the karta pobytu (residence card), ID card, or passport in Poland. 
### Who needs it?
Any person residing in Poland, whether citizen or foreigner, who has lost their official documentation, needs to follow this procedure.

## Procedure

1. The first step to report the loss of an official document is to go to the nearest police station to file a police report about the lost document. 

2. The next step is to go to your local voivodeship office.

For residents of Warsaw, it would be the Masovian Voivodeship office ([link](http://www.mazowieckie.pl/en/)).

3. You will need to bring a copy of the police report and fill out an application for a replacement document. 

## Required Documents

- Copy of police report detailing the loss of the document.
- Identification (any existing document).
- An updated photograph of yourself (can usually be taken on site).
