## Description
### What is it?
Document apostille is a certification process that verifies the legitimacy of official documents for international use. In Paraguay, this involves submitting personal or professional documents to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where they are authenticated so they can be recognized legally in other Hague Convention countries.

### Who needs it?
Ideal for individuals who plan to study, work, or live abroad, and businesses needing to authenticate documents for international transactions. It is especially useful for students enrolling in foreign universities, expatriates securing residency, and professionals validating credentials.

## Procedure

1. Step 1: Gather all required documents.
2. Step 2: Ensure each document is translated into the needed language by a certified translator.
3. Step 3: Visit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the designated apostille office.
4. Step 4: Submit the documents along with any required fees.
5. Step 5: Wait for the processing period, which can vary but generally takes a few business days.
6. Step 6: Retrieve your apostilled documents or receive them via mail if applicable.
