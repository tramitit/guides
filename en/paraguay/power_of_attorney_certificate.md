## Description
### What is it?
A Power of Attorney Certificate in Paraguay is a legal document that grants an individual the authority to act on behalf of another person in private, business, or legal matters. This certificate ensures that the designated person can make decisions, manage assets, and sign documents in the absence or incapacitation of the principal.

### Who needs it?
Individuals who are planning to reside abroad, need someone to manage their assets or take care of specific legal matters in Paraguay, and those who have business dealings in the country. It is also essential for elderly or incapacitated individuals who require a trusted person to handle their affairs.

## Procedure

2. Select a trusted individual to act as your proxy.
3. Consult with a local legal advisor or notary in Paraguay to draft the PoA document according to local regulations.
4. Gather and prepare all necessary documents, including personal identification and evidence of intent.
