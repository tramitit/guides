## Description
### What is it?
Paternity acknowledgment is a legal process by which a man accepts or is proven to be the biological father of a child. This can have significant legal ramifications, impacting the child's citizenship status, inheritance, and custody rights. This guide focuses on the process in Germany.

### Who needs it?
Any man who wishes to be legally recognized as the biological father of a child needs to go through the process of paternity acknowledgment.

## Procedure
1. The first step is for both parents to declare their intention to acknowledge paternity. This is usually done at the local youth welfare office (*Jugendamt*).
2. The next step is to provide the aforementioned youth welfare office with certain official documents. The exact documents required can vary, but they usually include your identity card and birth certificate.
3. If possible, the father should be present to give his acknowledgement personally at the youth welfare office. If not, a notarized declaration of consent can be presented.
4. After reviewing the documents, the officer will schedule a meeting with both parents to confirm the father's acknowledgement. This will be followed by a formal declaration of paternity, which is signed by both parents.
5. The parents will receive a certificate of acknowledgement of paternity from the officer. This document serves as proof of paternity recognition.

## Required Documents
- Passport or identity card
- Birth certificate of the child
- Birth certificate of the father
- Marriage certificate (if applicable)
- Notarized declaration of consent (if necessary)

## Additional details
The acknowledgment of paternity can be done either before or after the birth of the child; however, it also implies a financial commitment until the child has completed their education, including any further studies. So it is a decision that should not be taken lightly. If the parents are unwed, it also grants joint custody of the child.
