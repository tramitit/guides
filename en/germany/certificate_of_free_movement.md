## Description
### What is it?
A Certificate of Free Movement, known as "Freiz端gigkeitsbescheinigung" in Germany, is a document that ensures the rights of EU, EEA and Swiss citizens for visa-free living, working and studying within these nations.
### Who needs it?
EU, EEA and Swiss citizens who are residing in Germany and wish to travel, study or work in other EU, EEA countries or Switzerland.

## Procedure
1. Register your resident address with the corresponding local town hall or "B端rgeramt" within one or two weeks of moving. Note that this step is compulsory.
2. Apply for a Certificate of Free Movement at the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF).
3. Provide all necessary documents (see Required Documents section).
4. After verifying your application, the BAMF will issue a Certificate of Free Movement.

## Required Documents
