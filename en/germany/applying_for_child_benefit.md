2. Include details of your bank account where the payment will be transferred to.
3. Submit the application to your local Family Benefits Office (Familienkasse). If you are unsure where this is located, try contacting your local Agentur für Arbeit or your local town administration (Rathaus) and ask them where you can file the application.
