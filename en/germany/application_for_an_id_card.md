## Description
### What is it?
A German Identification Card (Personalausweis) is a legal form of identification in Germany and a travel document within most of Europe.

### Who needs it?
German citizens (including people who have successfully been naturalized in Germany) aged 16 or above are required to possess either a passport or a Personalausweis. The ID card may also be issued to minors, and for children aged below 10 years, it is issued without biometric features. 

## Procedure
1. Locate your local Residents' Registration Office (Bürgerbüro or Einwohnermeldeamt).
2. Make an appointment. Most offices offer online appointment booking.
3. Visit the office on the appointment day. 
4. Bring required documents (detailed list below). 
5. Application will be processed and your biometric data (photo and fingerprints) will be taken at the office.
6. Pay the fee for the ID card application.
7. After a few weeks, you will receive a notification indicating that your ID card is ready to pick-up.
8. Visit the office to collect your ID card. Don't forget to bring the notification letter.

## Required Documents
1. Current identification document (Expired ID-card, passport)
2. Recent biometric photograph. It must be conform to the international standards for Biometric photos.
3. For applicants under 16, you need a declaration of consent from the legal guardians.
4. Confirmation of registration (Korbmeldung) if you moved recently. 

## Providers that can do it for you

| Provider        |     Website     |     Timelines    |       Cost      |

## Additional details
The waiting period may vary depending on your location in Germany and the overall demand. Do take this period into account before applying for a new ID if your existing ID is about to expire. Your old expired ID does not count as a valid form of identification once it has expired. This is true even if you've already applied for a new one and are simply waiting for it to be processed.
