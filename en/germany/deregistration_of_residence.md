## Description
### What is it?
Deregistration of residence, or 'Abmeldung,' is the process of officially informing local authorities in Germany that you are no longer residing in your current residence, are leaving the district or moving out of Germany.

### Who needs it?
Anyone who has registered a residence (Wohnsitz) in Germany and plans to move out of that residence, the district, or leave the country entirely, is legally required to deregister their residence.

## Procedure
1. Obtain the required deregistration form from the local city hall (Bürgeramt).
2. Fill out the form with the necessary details.
3. Submit the form to the local city hall or by email/post if available. Usually, you can send the form directly to the Stadtverwaltung (city administration). Some cities, like Cologne, also offer an online process.

## Required Documents
- Completed deregistration (Abmeldung) form
- Proof of identity (passport or ID)

**Note:** Some cities might require additional documents like your rental contract or a letter from your landlord. Always check with the local authorities.

## Providers that can do it for you

## Additional details
- Remember that failing to deregister might result in financial penalties and complications with future registrations or visa applications.
- Keep a copy of your deregistration confirmation (Abmeldebestätigung). You might need this proof of deregistration for task closures with utilities companies, banks, and insurance agencies.
- You can deregister your residence in advance, maximum one week before leaving the property.
- If you're moving to a different address in Germany, you can usually handle deregistration and new registration at the same time.
- Make sure to update your address for important contracts and subscriptions to avoid any complications.
