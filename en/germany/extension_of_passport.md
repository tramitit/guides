## Description
### What is it?
In case your passport validity is about to expire, you would need to initiate the process of passport extension or renewal to ensure you can continue to travel internationally. This guide provides detailed steps on extending your passport. 

### Who needs it?
Any individual with an expiring passport who intends to engage in international travel would require an updated passport - this guide is useful for such individuals.

## Procedure 

1. **Check the date:** The first step is to check the expiry date of your passport. Some countries require that your passport be valid for six months beyond the dates of your trip. 

2. **Fill out the correct form:** If you are in the U.S., fill out form DS-82 if your previous passport was issued when you were age 16 or older and in the past 15 years. If not, fill out form DS-11. In Germany, you will need to fill out a passport application form which is available at the consulate or embassy. 

3. **Prepare your documents:** Along with your application form, you will need your current passport, one passport photo, and payment for the passport fee. 

4. **Submit your Application:** Either submit your completed application form in person at a designated local agency or send it by post. 

5. **Wait for Processing:** It may take a few weeks before you receive your new passport through mail. 

## Required Documents
- Current Passport
- One Passport Photo
  - The photo must be up-to-date, taken within the last six months, and conform to all photo requirements.
- Application Form
- Proof of Payment

## Additional details

Remember to check the specific requirements applicable for your country. For example, in Germany, it might be necessary to bring birth certificates or other documentation showing your citizenship status.

While not generally practical, extensions for touristic purposes can be done in some countries like Japan. These extensions are usually for a finite period and require significant documentation. Always factor in the processing times while planning your travels.
