2. Prepare necessary documents.
3. Pay the necessary fees.
4. The vehicle will undergo a technical inspection if required.

## Additional details
For foreigners, it is essential to have a permanent residence in Germany before you can register a vehicle. Even if not planning to use the vehicle, insurance is still necessary due to regulations in Germany. You are allowed to keep your existing vehicle registration plates when transferring ownership of a vehicle. If your vehicle registration expires and you fail to renew it, you may face penalties or fines.
