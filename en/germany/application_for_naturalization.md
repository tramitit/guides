## Description
### What is it?
Naturalization is the process of acquiring citizenship in a country other than the one the person has originally been a citizen of. This guide particularly focuses on naturalization in Germany.

### Who needs it?
Ideal for foreigners living in Germany who are intending to obtain German citizenship.

## Procedure

1. **Residency requirement:** Before you apply, ensure you have lived at least 8 years in Germany. You should also possess a permanent residence permit ([Niederlassungserlaubnis](https://www.bmi.bund.de/EN/topics/migration/residence-law/permanent-residence-permit/artikel-permanent-residence-permit.html;jsessionid=2C835EA5F24180BF2529A0DFE90CF22C.1_cid286))

2. **Check eligibility:** Fully understand the rules for applying for citizenship in order to know if you qualify. Visit the German Missions in the United States page on [Naturalization](https://www.germany.info/us-en/service/03-Citizenship/naturalization/925326) to learn more.

3. ** Preparing documentation:** Collect and make copies of all documents that you may need. This includes having official translations if your documents are not in German.

4. **Applying for Citizenship:** Contact your local city's naturalization office ([Einbürgerungsamt](https://www.berlin.de/labo/willkommen-in-berlin/einbuergerungen/)) to apply for citizenship. You should expect to meet with a case worker who will guide you through the process.

5. **Interview:** Prepare and attend a compulsory citizenship interview, where your application, background information and German knowledge will be reviewed.

6. **Citizenship test:** Pass the naturalization test. You can find a guide and a selection of test questions on the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees’ [Website](http://www.bamf.de/EN/Willkommen/Einbuergerung/Testvorbereitung/testvorbereitung-node.html)

7. **Receiving citizenship:** Finally, after submitting the documentation, taking the interview and passing the examination, you will receive a citizenship certificate.
