## Description
### What is it?
The resident registration database is a collection of information on the residents of a certain area. This information, usually stored and managed by local authorities, typically includes details such as name, address, citizenship, date of birth, and other personal data. With certain legal justification, pieces of this information can often be requested and retrieved. 

### Who needs it?
Often, people involved with genealogy or family research, individuals tracing long-lost relatives or friends, or even organizations pertaining to law enforcement and detective work will find such databases invaluable.

## Procedure
1. If you're in Germany, visit or contact the local registration office ("Einwohnermeldeamt") as they may have access to resident registration records.
2. Show an identity document and explain the reason for your request.
3. You may need to fill out a request form providing detailed information about the person you are looking for.
4. After fulfilling the formalities, if your request meets the necessary criteria, the authorities will commence the search.
5. Await response from the authorities.

## Required Documents
- Proof of identity (Passport, ID card or Driving Licence)
- Completed request form (if applicable)
