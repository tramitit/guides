## Description
### What is it?
A residence permit – "Aufenthaltstitel" or "Aufenthaltserlaubnis" in German, is a document that gives foreign nationals the right to stay in Germany either temporarily or permanently.

### Who needs it?
Any non-European Union citizen who plans to stay in Germany for more than 90 days, or work there, needs to apply for a residence permit. 

## Procedure
1. Initial Entry: You must initially enter Germany with a National Visa if you plan to stay for more than 90 days or want to work.

2. Gather Required Documents: Make sure you have all the required documents and they are up to date.

3. Register: Register your living address in Germany at the local Resident’s Registration Office.

4. Application: Apply for your residence permit at the local immigration authority (Foreigners Authority).

5. Wait: After the application, you may have to wait around 1 or 2 months until you receive your residence permit.

## Required Documents
- A valid passport
- Biometric photos
- Proof of a secure livelihood (proof of income or sufficient financial assets)
- Health Insurance: The German government requires all residents, including foreigners, to carry health insurance
- Proof of personal status in your home country, like birth certificate, marriage certificate, and similar
- Proof of address in Germany

*The documents needed can vary depending on your nationality and purpose of stay, so it's recommended to check with your local embassy or consulate.*

## Additional details
While waiting for the residence permit, it's recommended not to leave Germany unless it's an unavoidable circumstance as it may raise issues during the process. The residence permit is not a physical document, but a sticker in one's passport. If your residence permit expires, the process and consequences can vary, therefore it is highly recommended to renew it on time. In some cases, people who have left Germany for over six months had to apply for a residence permit all over again. 

It's also worth mentioning that there are different types of residence permits, like the Temporary Residence Permit, the EU Blue Card and the Permanent Residence Permit. The right one for you will depend on your specific circumstances.
