## Additional details
Please note that it's against the law to have Anmeldung in two places at the same time in Germany. In case you are changing your apartment within the same city, you don’t need to de-register (Abmeldung) from your old address you only need to register (Anmeldung) at your new address. If you are owning a vehicle, it is also mandatory to provide the same residential address as on your driving license to the vehicle registration office. It's also important to inform your broadcasting service provider (like ARD, ZDF, and Deutschlandradio) about the change in your residential address. Your registration document (Meldebescheinigung) might be necessary for opening a bank account, getting a cellphone contract, etc. Please remember to register yourself within two weeks after relocating to your new address.
