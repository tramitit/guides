## Description
### What is it?
A temporary license plate, also known as a "Zulassungsstelle", is a short-term registration which allows individuals to operate a vehicle while waiting for permanent license plates. 

### Who needs it?
It is ideal for individuals who have recently purchased a vehicle and are waiting for their official license plates or individuals who are importing a car and need to navigate the registration process. 

## Procedure
1. Go to your local registration office (Zulassungsbeh√∂rde), which can be found by searching for "Kfz-Zulassungsstelle" followed by the name of your city.
2. Present your documents - including proof of insurance, vehicle title, and your identification.
3. Pay the fee as prescribed. 
4. After receiving the temporary plates, attach them to your vehicle.

## Required Documents
- Proof of identity (such as passport or ID card)
- Proof of insurance (eVB number)
- Registration certificate of the vehicle 

Note: The above are general documents that are usually required, other documents may be needed depending on the specific rules of your locality. Please check the details with your local registration office.

## Additional details
- Temporary license plates are usually valid for a short period of time (5-10 days), after which you should have received your permanent plates.
- Driving with temporary plates outside the country may not be legal depending on the laws of the countries you intend to visit, so it is recommended to clarify this before undertaking any travel.
- In some cases, you might be able to handle the entire process online or via mail, again this depends on the policy of your local registration office.
