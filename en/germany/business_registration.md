## Description
### What is it?
Business registration, or Gewerbeanmeldung, is a process in Germany which legally designates a commercial activity. This is to ensure government oversight and taxation. 

### Who needs it?
Individuals or entities looking to start or expand their entrepreneurial undertaking in Germany on either a self-employed or company base.

## Procedure

1. Obtain a residence permit (Aufenthaltstitel), if you are a non-EU citizen. You may apply for it through the [Federal Office for Migration and Refugees](http://www.bamf.de/EN/).

2. Register at [Berlin City Hall](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120686/) or at your local Ordnungsamt for the Gewerbeanmeldung, for self-employment.
 
3. If you plan to open a corporation or partnership (like a GmbH, UG, or OHG), you'll need to draw up articles of association, have them notarized, and register at the [Handelsregister](https://www.handelsregister.de/rp_web/welcome.do) (Commercial Register).

4. Register for [VAT](https://www.bzst.de/DE/Home/home_node.html), if your business revenue exceeds 22,000 Euros in its first year or 50,000 Euros the following year.
   
## Required Documents

1. Completed application form (anmeldung formular)
2. Valid ID or passport 
3. If a non-EU citizen, valid residence permit 
4. Registration document from the Ordnungsamt
5. Business concept details
6. Approved articles of association ((Satzung) for corporations and partnerships

## Additional details

Remember that some professionals (like doctors, tax consultants, architects, and lawyers) do not need a Gewerbeanmeldung as they are considered freelance, not commercial. Instead, they need to register a freelance business with the tax office (Finanzamt).

The Gewerbeanmeldung form requires details of your business concept - what type of business you are starting, where your business is located, and how it is funded. This information is used for tax purposes and to ensure that your business complies with trading laws and regulations.

If you plan to sell goods online via platforms like Etsy or Amazon, it is important to register for VAT (Umsatzsteuer) as well through the Bundeszentralamt f√ºr Steuern website. This is necessary for tax and business trading purposes. 

Note that if you are a freelancer or do not reach the threshold for mandatory VAT registration, you can opt for Kleinunternehmerregelung (small business scheme) where you do not charge VAT to your customers. Also, investing in a tax adviser (Steuerberater) can benefit you efficiently to navigate German tax laws and regulations.
