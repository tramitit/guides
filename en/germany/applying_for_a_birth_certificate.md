## Description
### What is it?
A birth certificate is a vital record that documents the birth of a child. It typically includes details such as date of birth, sex of the child, name of parents, and the place of birth. 

### Who needs it?
Anyone born in Germany, who needs to prove their citizenship, identity, or other matters related to personal identity, or those applying for German citizenship by descent.

## Procedure
1. Identify the relevant Standesamt (Civil Registry Office) in the city where the birth took place. 
2. Write a letter to the Standesamt requesting for a birth certificate. This should include the full name at birth, date of birth, and names of parents. You can request for an International Birth Certificate which is multilingual.
3. Include a self-addressed stamped envelope for the office to send back the certificate. 
4. Pay the necessary fee, which is usually around €10 to €20, to process the birth certificate request. This could be done through bank transfer. 

## Required Documents
1. Proof of identity (passport or ID card)
2. Proof of relationship or entitlement to apply (like your own birth certificate showing your parents' names)

## Additional details
- Processing times can vary significantly, ranging from a few days to several weeks, depending on the specific Standesamt. Regular follow-up might expedite the process.
- If the birth took place before 1876, church records may need to be examined. This may increase the processing time and potential complexity.
- Not all older records are available due to historical events such as World War II. Make sure to confirm whether the needed records still exist.
