## Description
### What is it?
In Germany, public broadcasting is funded by a mandatory broadcasting fee, known as the "Rundfunkbeitrag." It is a monthly fee that residents within Germany are required to pay, regardless of whether they use public broadcasting services or not.

### Who needs it?
Every household in Germany must pay for the broadcasting fee. This doesn't necessarily mean that every individual must pay. If several individuals live together in a shared residence, they constitute a single "household", and only one fee is due. Foreign students and professionals living in Germany must also register and pay the fee.

## Procedure
1. As soon as you become a resident in Germany, visit the official Rundfunkbeitrag website [here](https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/welcome/englisch/index_ger.html).
2. On the website, go to the "Register Now" section and click on the link there.
3. You'll be directed to a registration form, which you should fill out and submit.
4. You may choose between different payment methods like direct debit, bank transfer or payment service providers. 

## Required Documents
To register for the broadcasting fee, you will need your personal details and the address in Germany where you are registered. The form can be filled in and submitted online itself.

## Providers that can do it for you

## Additional details
If there are multiple people in a household, this fee is shared among all, and it is just paid once per household rather than per person. If you move, it's your responsibility to update your new address on the website. Importantly, not paying the broadcasting fee can result in penalties, and it is regarded as a regulatory offence in Germany.
