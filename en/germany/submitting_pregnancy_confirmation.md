## Description
### What is it?
Submitting pregnancy confirmation involves providing formal proof that you are pregnant. This might be necessary in various situations, for instance when taking a pregnancy-related leave at work, or when requesting a pregnancy-related service or accommodation. 
### Who needs it?
This procedure is typically necessary for pregnant persons who need to inform their employer about their pregnancy and maternity leave plans; or those who need to inform service providers such as airlines about their pregnant condition for certain accommodations.

## Procedure
1. Visit a healthcare provider to obtain a pregnancy confirmation. This confirmation can come in various forms, such as a pregnancy test result or a doctor's note.
2. Submit this confirmation to the concerned party. This might be your employer, an airline, or another service provider. The method of submission can vary. You might need to email the proof, upload it to a portal, or submit it in person.
3. Follow up with the concerned party to make sure they have received and acknowledged your submission. This is especially important if there are deadlines involved.

## Required Documents
