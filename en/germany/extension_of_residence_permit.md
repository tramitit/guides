### What is it?
The extension of residence permit is a procedure that allows an individual, who is not a citizen of Germany, to extend their stay in the country beyond the expiry date of their initial residence permit.

### Who needs it?
Any foreign national living in Germany who wishes to remain in the country beyond the valid period of their residence permit needs to apply for an extension.

## Procedure

3. Book an appointment with the Foreigners Authority in advance. This can usually be done online via the official website.
4. During your appointment, you will have to fill out an application form and submit the required documents.
