## Description
### What is it?
A Social Security card in Germany is needed for anyone who is working. It contains your social security number, which is a unique identification number for social security purposes.

### Who needs it?
Every working individual living in Germany, including international students and expatriates.

## Procedure
1. Register your address at the local Resident Registration Office (Einwohnermeldeamt). Make sure you have your passport and proof of address, such as a rental contract.
2. If you have a job, your employer will usually apply for a social security card on your behalf. They will ask for your details and contact the local Health Insurance Company (Krankenkasse) to initiate the process.
3. If you do not have a job and are not an EU citizen, you will need to apply personally at the local social insurance office (Sozialversicherungsanstalt) for your social security card.

## Required Documents
- Passport
- Proof of address (such as a rental contract)
- If you have a job, your contract of employment or the offer
- If you're an EU citizen, proof of EU citizenship

## Additional details
The social security card (Sozialversicherungsausweis) should be kept safely. Do not worry if you lose it - your number is permanent. You can request a replacement card through the same procedure. Remember, everyone who is employed in Germany gets a unique life-long social security number in order to have access to social security, including health insurance, unemployment insurance, and pension fund.
