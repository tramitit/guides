## Description
### What is it?
BAföG is a financial aid service provided by the German government to students looking to begin or continue their studies in Germany. This service is intended to make it easier for students to fund their education without worrying about financial constraints.

### Who needs it?
Students who are residents of Germany (either EU-citizens or non-EU) and international students who plan to study in Germany can apply for BAföG. It can be especially beneficial for those who have limited self or family resources to pay for their studies.

## Procedure
1. **Test eligibility:** Use an online eligibility calculator like [BAföG-Rechner](https://www.bafoeg-rechner.de/Rechner/) to determine whether you qualify for BAföG assistance. 
2. **Prepare documents:** Gather all necessary documents to prove your financial situation, residence status, and admission into a German university or school.
3. **Submit application:** Fill in the [online application](https://www.bafoeg.bmbf.de/) or apply in person at your local student financing office (Studentenwerk).
4. **Wait for response:** After you have submitted your application, the authorities will process it and you will be notified of the decision within a few weeks.

## Required Documents
- Proof of residence (such as registration certificate from the local Residents' Registration Office)
- Proof of admission into a German school or university
- Financial documents to show your income and assets
- Parent's financial information (for dependent students)

## Additional details
- The amount of BAföG awarded depends on several factors, including the student's income and assets, parents' income, and whether the student lives with their parents or independently.
- Half of the BAföG aid is provided as a grant, and the other half as an interest-free loan, which needs to be paid back after finishing your studies.
- Non-EU students can also apply for BAföG, but they usually need to have lived in Germany for a certain period of time (usually 5 years) and demonstrate the intention to stay in Germany long-term. They also need to show that they are unable to receive financial support from their home country.
