## Description
### What is it?
A certificate of enrollment is a document that validates and proves a student's active enrollment status at an educational institution. Its primary function is to provide confirmation that a student is registered for a specific number of courses or credits in a given semester or academic year.
### Who needs it?
Certificate of enrollment is needed by students who want to prove their current status as a registered student. It can be requested by high school, undergraduate, and graduate students who may need it for a variety of reasons such as visa applications, financial matters, insurance purposes, or compliance with scholarship requirements.

## Procedure
To request a certificate of enrollment, the procedure may vary by institution, but generally, the steps are:

1. Log in to your school's online portal or account system. 
2. Navigate to the academics or student services section.
3. Look for the “verification request” or "enrollment verification" option.
4. Fill out the necessary information. Indicate the purpose of your request if needed.
5. Submit your request and wait for the processing time.
6. Once processed, you would either be able to download the document or be directed on how and where to collect it. 

## Required Documents
Typically, the required documents or information are:

1. Full Name
2. Student ID number

Also, the certificate does not typically disclose the subjects a student is enrolled in or their grades, just their enrollment status.
