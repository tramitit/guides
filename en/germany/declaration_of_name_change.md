## Description
### What is it?
A declaration of name change refers to the legal process of changing a person's given or surname in Germany. This process is governed by the German law and requires several steps to be accomplished.

### Who needs it?
Any person residing in Germany who desires to change their name for personal, religious, ethnic, or any non-fraudulent reason may need to follow this process. 

## Procedure

1. To initiate a name change declaration, you need to apply to your local civil registry (Standesamt).
2. Fill out the necessary application forms that detail your current information and requested changes.
3. Submit the completed application along with the required documents. 
4. Pay the associated fees.
5. Upon successful submission of documents and payment of fees, the office will process your application. It may involve an investigation into the reason for your name change.
6. Once approved, the civil registry office will issue a certificate reflecting your new name.

## Required Documents

The required documents might vary depending on the individual situation. However, typically the following documents are required:

1. Valid proof of identification (such as a passport or ID card)
