## Description
### What is it?
Vehicle deregistration or 'Abmeldung' is the process by which a vehicle is officially taken off from the traffic register. It is usually required when transferring ownership, scrapping, or exporting the vehicle to another country.

### Who needs it?
Any vehicle owner in Germany who intends to sell, scrap, or permanently remove their car from the country would need to go through the deregistration process.

## Procedure
1. Take your vehicle's registration certificate part I (Fahrzeugschein) and part II (Fahrzeugbrief), as well as the vehicle's number plates to your local registration office (Kfz-Zulassungsstelle). 
2. Fill out a de-registration form (Abmeldung) and submit it along with the documents mentioned above. You can find this form at the registration office.
3. The registration office will then remove the vehicle from the register and provide you with a deregistration certificate (Abmeldebescheinigung). Store this certificate carefully.

## Required Documents
1. Registration certificate part I (Zulassungsbescheinigung Teil I)
2. Registration certificate part II (Zulassungsbescheinigung Teil II)
3. Existing number plates
4. De-registration form

## Additional details
The de-registration process is pretty straightforward and can usually be carried out right away at the local registration office. However, be sure to check the specific operating hours and the availability of services as they might vary depending on the location. 

Saving your Abmeldebescheinigung (de-registration certificate) is extremely important, as it's the proof that you're no longer associated with this vehicle for any fines, penalties or charges.
