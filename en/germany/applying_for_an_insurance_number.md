## Description
### What is it?
An insurance number, also known as Sozialversicherungsnummer, is a unique identification number assigned to each resident in Germany for the purpose of social security. It is used for all dealings with social insurance carriers, employers, and tax authorities.

### Who needs it?
Every person who either works or lives in Germany requires this number. Foreigners who have just arrived in the country for work or study also require this number. It is especially important for the processing of health insurance, pensions, and any other social benefits.

## Procedure
1. Register your place of residence at the local Resident Registration Office (Einwohnermeldeamt or BÃ¼rgeramt). Here, you will require an address in Germany.
2. Open a bank account. You will need this bank account to receive your salary payments and to pay your insurance contributions. Here is a relevant link that can help you open a bank account: [German bank account](https://www.german-way.com/travel-and-tourism/living-in-germany/banking/)
3. Apply for health insurance from a German insurance provider. Here is a vigilant link: [Health insurance in Germany](https://www.german-way.com/travel-and-tourism/health-care/health-insurance/)
4. Your employer will ask for your health insurance details, and they will register you for pension insurance (Rentenversicherung), unemployment insurance (Arbeitslosenversicherung), and other social security schemes.
5. You will receive by post the Sozialversicherungsausweis, a green document with your name and your Social Insurance Number on it.

## Additional details
The Sozialversicherungsnummer or insurance number is not the same as your tax ID (Steuer ID) or your tax number (Steuernummer). The tax ID is another unique reference number for tax purposes. If you're asked for an insurance number at your university or a job, they usually refer to your German public health insurance number.
