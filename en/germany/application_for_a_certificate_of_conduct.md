## Description
### What is it?
A certificate of conduct, also known as a "Führungszeugnis" in Germany, is a document that confirms whether or not an individual has a criminal record. This could be compared to a police clearance certificate in other countries.

### Who needs it?
This certificate is often requested by employers when applying for certain jobs in Germany. It may also be necessary for individuals applying for a visa or citizenship.

## Procedure
1. You can apply for a Führungszeugnis at your local "Bürgeramt" (resident registration office). Find the nearest office to your location [here](https://www.berlin.de/buergeraemter/). It is recommended to phone ahead for an appointment.
2. Once at the Bürgeramt, you will need to fill out an application form and pay the fee.
3. After about two weeks, the Führungszeugnis will be sent by post to the address provided on the application form.

## Required Documents
1. A valid photo ID or passport.
2. Proof of residence (such as a recent utility bill).
3. The necessary fee (currently 13 Euros, can change). 

## Providers that can do it for you

| Provider        |     Website     |     Timelines    |       Cost      |
| --------------- | --------------- |  :-------------: | :-------------: |
| Bürgeramt       |  [https://www.berlin.de/buergeraemter/](https://www.berlin.de/buergeraemter/)      |      2 weeks   |   13€    |

## Additional details
The Certificate of Conduct comes in two forms: "Belegart N' which goes directly to your address, and "Belegart O" which is sent to an authority such as your employer. For a job application, your employer might request a "Belegart O". It's good to know this information, so you apply for the right version based on your needs. 

If you are applying from abroad, you might need to ask a trusted person in Germany to submit and collect the certificate on your behalf. However, the certificate will be mailed to the address on the application, which must be in Germany. 

Also, note that the certificate is only valid for a limited period of time (usually three months), so always apply close to the time you'll need to use it. Moreover, if your criminal record is clear, the certificate will explicitly state that your record is empty.
