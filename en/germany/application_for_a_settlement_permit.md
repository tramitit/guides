## Description
### What is it?
A Settlement Permit, also known as a Niederlassungserlaubnis, is a residence permit for foreign nationals who wish to stay in Germany permanently.

### Who needs it?
This permit is intended for those who have been living in Germany for a certain number of years and meet specific requirements such as financial stability, sufficient living space, and adequate knowledge of the German language. 

## Procedure
1. Gather all needed documents (see the "Required Documents" section below).
2. Fill out the relevant application form. The form will depend on your specific circumstances (e.g. permanent residency due to EU Blue Card, Self-Employment, etc.).
3. Schedule an appointment with your local Foreigners Registration Office (Ausländerbehörde).
4. Attend your appointment and submit your application. Make sure to bring all documents with you, plus any additional documents requested by the Ausländerbehörde based on your specific circumstances. 

## Required Documents
- Valid passport
- Current residence permit
- Certificate of registration at the main residence
- Biometric photographs
- Proof of secure livelihood, including health insurance
- Proof of language skills
- Employment contract or job offer (if applicable)
- Proof of pension entitlements (if applicable)

Documents can vary depending on individual circumstances. For a complete list, check the [Ausländerbehörde](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/amt/en/aufenthalt/erloeschen/) or your local Foreigners Registration Office.

## Additional details
Note: Details can vary depending on your current permit, the city you live in, your job situation, and other personal circumstances. Always consult the Ausländerbehörde or an immigration lawyer if unsure about the specifics. It's important to know that holding a residence permit for other EU states does not entitle you to a settlement permit in Germany. You must be a resident in Germany to apply.
