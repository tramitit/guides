## Description
### What is it?
A marriage certificate is an official record document issued by a government that proves that the couple listed on the certificate have been legally married. This particular guide covers how to obtain a marriage certificate in Germany for marriages that were performed outside of that country.

### Who needs it?
Individuals who got married outside of Germany and need to register their marriage inside the country or anyone who needs to prove that their marriage is legal for any reason (for example, for bureaucratic or legal matters).

## Procedure
1. If you were married outside of Germany, ensure that you have all the necessary legal documentation from the country where the marriage was performed. 
2. Translate all documents into German by an approved translator if they're not originally in German. The decision to translate documents should be made on a case-to-case basis as regulations can vary depending on the city.
3. Apply for a marriage certificate at your local Standesamt (civil registration office) in Germany.
4. Submit all required documents (listed below) at the Standesamt. 
5. The Standesamt will then verify your documents and issue a marriage certificate, if approved.

## Required Documents
The documents needed to apply for a marriage certificate can vary depending on the specific circumstances of the couple, but often include:
1. Proof of Identification (e.g. passport)
2. The original marriage certificate from the country the marriage was performed. 
3. Complete "Certificate of Marriage" form.
4. Any further documentation that proves the legality of the marriage.

## Additional details
Note that this process can take some time to complete, as the Standesamt will need to verify the legality of the foreign marriage. It is recommended to apply several months in advance of any deadlines. Also, note that some marriages performed outside of Germany may not be considered legally binding within the country. It is recommended to seek legal advice if you're unsure about the legality of your marriage.
