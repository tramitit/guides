## Additional details

- Unemployment benefit is calculated as a percentage of your average earnings over the last 12 months before becoming unemployed.
- After you have registered yourself as unemployed, you are considered available for work and should not leave Germany for more than a combined total of 21 days in a calendar year without notifying the Federal Employment Agency.
- It is also possible to freelance while receiving unemployment benefits but you need to inform and get approval from the Federal Employment Agency. However, your freelancing earnings would be deducted from your unemployment benefits. 
- You are also required to report to the job center regularly (monthly or bi-monthly) and show that you're actively seeking employment.
