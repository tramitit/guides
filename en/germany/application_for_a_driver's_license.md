## Description
### What is it?
This service is the process of applying for a German driver's license. 
### Who needs it?
It's aimed at foreign residents in Germany, particularly those moving from non-EU countries and some EU countries whose licenses are not automatically recognized in Germany. Technically, residents of recognized countries can freely use their existing licenses, but it's generally recommended to get a German one if you plan on settling in the country long-term.

## Procedure
1. Register at your local district office (Bürgeramt) after moving to Germany. Most of them propose appointments [online](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120686/).
2. Attend a first aid course. The course usually lasts one day and costs around 35€. 
3. Pass an eye test. This can be done at an optician for around 20€.
4. Pass the theoretical exam. You will need to obtain study materials and, in most cases, you may need to take a course at a driving school. Look for Fahrschulen in your area to get this service.
5. Pass the practical exam. Usually, this includes mandatory driving hours with a recognized school.

## Required Documents
- Proof of address
- Passport
- Foreign driver's license
- Certificate from the first-aid course
- Evidence of passing the eye test
- Training certificate from a driving school (Fahrschule)

## Additional details
- Your foreign license remains valid in Germany for either six months from your date of registering at the Bürgeramt, or six months from your arrival date if you are from a non-EU country and not planning on becoming a resident.
- Certain states in the USA, such as California, have a reciprocity agreement with Germany allowing their residents to exchange their licenses without taking a driving test.
- The process to exchange a UK driving license for a German one is currently a grey area due to changing Brexit regulations. It's recommended to consult with local authorities for the most up-to-date information.
