## Description
### What is it?
A Certificate of Conduct, or Führungszeugnis in German, is an official document issued by the German government. It serves as a record of criminal convictions or lack thereof.

2. Log in using your identification details.
3. Fill out the online application form. Make sure to provide all necessary information and double-check for accuracy.
4. Pay the application fee (currently 13 Euros). Payment can be made via direct debit or credit card.
5. You'll receive a confirmation email after your successful application.
6. The document will be sent by mail to your registered address.

## Additional details
- Please note that the document is generally sent to the address registered in your identity document, so make sure your information is up to date.
- The procedure can also be completed at a local Bürgeramt (Citizen’s Office), but the online option can save time and effort.
- The entire process is generally straightforward, although some knowledge of German is beneficial as the online form and related documentation are usually only available in German.
- In case you need the certificate urgently, you can request it in person at a Bürgeramt and get it typically on the same day for an additional fee.
- Be aware that records are typically expunged from the certificate after a certain period of time. The precise duration depends on the nature of the offence and the legal provisions applicable to the case.
