## Additional details
Processing time for visa applications can vary depending on the embassy, consulate, or time of year. It's advisable to apply as early as possible.

Also, remember to attend your visa interview with all necessary documents. These documents should be in order and neatly arranged, to present to the interviewer. Any missing documents can result in visa denial. Also, the confirmation of appointment you receive through email after booking an appointment is very important and should not be lost or damaged. Even after a successful interview, issuance of visas is not guaranteed. You are advised to refrain from making definitive travel arrangements until the visa has been issued and you have it in your possession.
