## Description
### What is it?
A Colombian marriage certificate is an official document proving the marriage between two individuals in Colombia. This certificate is necessary for various legal processes, such as visa applications, changes in marital status, and international recognitions of the marriage.

### Who needs it?
This service is ideal for expats living in Colombia, dual citizens, and international couples who have married or plan to marry in Colombia. It's also beneficial for those going through immigration processes or needing to legalize their marriage abroad.

## Procedure

1. Visit the local Registrar's office (Registraduría Nacional) or an authorized notary.
2. Present all required documents (see list below).
3. Complete the official marriage registration form.
4. Pay the applicable fees for the service.
5. Wait for the processing time, typically ranging from a few days to a few weeks.

## Required documents

- Valid passports or national IDs of both spouses.
- Copies of birth certificates of both spouses, translated into Spanish and apostilled if from another country.
