## Description
### What is it?
A housing subsidy in Colombia is a form of financial assistance provided by the government to help individuals or families purchase their own home. This subsidy can be used to cover part of the costs associated with buying a home, such as the down payment or mortgage installments. The program is aimed at making home ownership more accessible to a broader segment of the population, particularly for young people and those with lower incomes.

### Who needs it?
This service is ideal for young individuals and families in Colombia who aspire to buy their first home but lack sufficient funds for the initial down payment or monthly mortgage payments. It is particularly beneficial for those currently paying rent and looking to transition into home ownership. Additionally, postdoctoral researchers, international teachers, and certain professions like flight attendants planning to settle in Colombia may find the subsidy beneficial.
