## Description
### What is it?
Document legalization in Colombia involves certifying the authenticity of a document to be used for legal purposes abroad. This process ensures the document is recognized in foreign jurisdictions, often required for marriage, employment, or further studies. The service includes obtaining an apostilleâ€”a specialized certificate issued by the Colombian government verifying the document's legitimacy.

### Who needs it?
This service is essential for expats living in Colombia who need their documents to be legally recognized in their home or other foreign countries. It is also necessary for foreigners who plan to get married in Colombia, apply for a job, or pursue further education abroad. Additionally, business professionals dealing with international contracts and agreements might need this service.

## Procedure

1. Gather the required documents to be legalized.
2. Verify that each document meets the necessary conditions for legalization.
3. Submit the documents to the relevant Colombian authority, typically the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
4. Pay the required fees for the legalization service.
5. Await the processing period, which can vary.
6. Pick up your legalized documents or have them mailed to you if the service permits.
