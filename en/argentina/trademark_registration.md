## Description
### What is it?
Trademark registration in Argentina is a legal process that grants the exclusive right to use a name, logo, or symbol in connection with your goods or services. This service ensures that your brand is protected from unauthorized use and provides legal recourse in case of infringement. The registration process involves filing an application, undergoing examination, and, if approved, receiving a trademark certificate.

### Who needs it?
This service is ideal for business owners, entrepreneurs, and companies in Argentina who wish to protect their brand identity. It is especially beneficial for those in highly competitive markets such as fashion, technology, and entertainment. Entrepreneurs launching new products or services and businesses looking to expand their operations should also consider trademark registration to safeguard their brand assets.

## Procedure

1. Conduct a trademark search to ensure the desired name/logo is available.
2. Prepare and file an application with the Instituto Nacional de la Propiedad Industrial (INPI).
3. Submit the required documents along with the application.
4. INPI conducts an examination of the application to check for compliance with legal requirements.
5. If no objections are raised, your trademark is published in the Trademarks Bulletin.
6. After a mandatory opposition period, if no oppositions are received, the trademark is registered.
7. Receive your trademark certification from INPI, confirming your brand's legal protection.
