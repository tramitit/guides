## Description
### What is it?
The Proof of Residency in Argentina, also known as the Certificado de Domicilio, is an official document that verifies an individual's residence address in Argentina. This document is often required for various legal and administrative processes, including opening a bank account, enrolling in schools, or obtaining a driver's license.

### Who needs it?
Expats, digital nomads, and anyone planning to reside in Argentina for an extended period will need this service. This includes foreign workers, students, and retirees who are either seeking temporary or permanent residency in Argentina. If you are opening a local bank account or registering for local services, you will also need this proof.

## Procedure

1. Visit your local police station or office of the National Immigration Department (https://www.argentina.gob.ar)
2. Request a Certificado de Domicilio form and fill in your details.
3. Provide the necessary identification documents, such as your passport and any visa information.
4. An officer may visit your home to verify the address provided.
5. Once verified, you will receive your Certificado de Domicilio.
