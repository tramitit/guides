## Description
### What is it?
The Death Record service in Argentina involves obtaining an official death certificate, which serves as a legal document confirming an individualâ€™s death. This certificate contains essential information such as the date, place, and cause of death, and is issued by local civil registration offices. It's often necessary for legal, genealogical, and administrative purposes.

### Who needs it?
Ideal customers for this service are family members or legal representatives of the deceased who require an official death certificate for estate settlement, insurance claims, genealogical research, or other legal purposes. Additionally, expatriates and individuals living abroad who need to handle affairs in Argentina may also benefit from this service.

## Procedure

1. Obtain the basic information about the deceased, including full name, date of birth, date of death, and place of death.
2. Visit the local civil registration office (Registro Civil) where the death was registered.
3. Fill out the application form for the death certificate, providing the necessary details about the deceased.
4. Submit the application along with the required documents.
