## Description
### What is it?
A Document Authenticity Certificate in Bolivia is a legal validation provided by the government that certifies the authenticity of a document. This service ensures that the documents you present, such as birth certificates, academic credentials, or official records, are recognized as genuine and can be used legally in other countries. This certification is often required for immigration, employment, education, or other legal processes abroad.

### Who needs it?
This service is ideal for Bolivian nationals and residents planning to move abroad for work, study, or long-term residence. It is also essential for foreign nationals who recently acquired documents in Bolivia and need them recognized in their home countries. Individuals going through international marriage or adoption processes may also require this service.
