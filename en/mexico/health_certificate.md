## Description
### What is it?
A Health Certificate is a document required for pets traveling internationally to ensure they meet the destination country's health and vaccination standards. For Mexico, this includes proof of vaccinations and a checkup by a licensed veterinarian, ensuring your pet is healthy and free from any contagious diseases.

### Who needs it?
This service is ideal for pet owners planning to travel to Mexico with their pets. It's essential for those relocating, enjoying an extended holiday, or any pet owner who wants to ensure their pet's entry into Mexico is smooth and compliant with local regulations.

## Procedure

1. Schedule an appointment with a licensed veterinarian familiar with international travel requirements.
2. Ensure your pet is up-to-date on all vaccinations mandated by Mexico, particularly rabies, and have proof of these vaccinations.
3. During your vet visit, the veterinarian will conduct a physical exam to ensure your pet shows no signs of infectious diseases.
4. Ask your veterinarian to fill out the health certificate, ensuring it's issued within the timeframe required (typically within 10 days of travel).
5. Submit the completed health certificate to the appropriate authorities for endorsement, if necessary.
6. Carry the original health certificate and any required documentation during your travel.


## Required documents

- Recent Vaccination Records: Obtain these from your veterinarian documenting rabies and other vaccinations.
- Health Certificate Completed by a Veterinarian: Schedule an appointment to get this filled out and signed.
