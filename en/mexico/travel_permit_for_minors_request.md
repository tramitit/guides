## Description
### What is it?
The Travel Permit for Minors in Mexico is a mandatory authorization required for children under the age of 18 traveling without both parents. This permit ensures the child's legal right to travel and safeguards against abduction or illegal relocation.

### Who needs it?
This service is essential for any minor traveling in or out of Mexico without the accompaniment of both parents. This includes single parents, guardians, and any adult traveling with a child who isn't their own. The service is particularly important for those traveling for vacations, family visits, or relocations.

1. Visit the official Mexican immigration website to access the application form.
2. Fill out the application form with accurate details about the minor, parents, and travel plans.
3. Gather all required documents, including identification for the minor and parents, proof of travel plans, and notarized consent.
4. Submit the completed application form along with the required documents to the nearest Mexican consulate or through online services.
5. Await confirmation and processing of the application. This typically takes a few days to a few weeks.
6. Receive the permit and ensure it is carried by the minor during travel.


## Required documents

- A valid passport for the minor
