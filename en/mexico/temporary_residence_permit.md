## Description
### What is it?
The Mexican Temporary Residence Permit is a legal document that allows foreign nationals to live in Mexico for an extended period, typically more than 180 days and up to four years. This permit is ideal for individuals moving for work, retirement, digital nomadism, or other long-term stays. The process involves providing necessary documentation, meeting financial requirements, and often attending an appointment at a Mexican consulate or immigration office.

### Who needs it?
This service is tailored for expatriates, digital nomads, retirees, and anyone planning to stay in Mexico for more than six months but less than four years. Ideal customers include those moving for employment reasons, business opportunities, or simply wishing to experience life in Mexico for an extended time without becoming permanent residents.

## Procedure

1. Research the requirements specific to your consulate.
2. Schedule an appointment at the Mexican consulate in your home country.
3. Gather and prepare the necessary documents (see the list below).
4. Attend your consulate appointment with your documents for initial approval.
5. Once approved, enter Mexico and complete the process at the National Institute of Immigration (INM) within 30 days.
6. Submit additional paperwork and biometrics at the INM office to receive the residence card.
