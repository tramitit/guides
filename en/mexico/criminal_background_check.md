This certificate is often required for various purposes such as immigration, employment, or legal processes.

### Who needs it?
Ideal customers for this service include expatriates living in Mexico, Mexican citizens applying for immigration to other countries (such as Canada), employers requiring background checks for their employees, and individuals needing the document for visa or residency applications.
