## Description
### What is it?
Renewing your Voter ID in Mexico is an essential civic duty that ensures your right to vote and access to various services. The process involves updating your details or revalidating your identification card at the INE (Instituto Nacional Electoral) offices.

### Who needs it?
The Voter ID renewal service is ideal for Mexican citizens over 18 years of age who need to update their identification details, replace a lost card, or ensure their eligibility to vote in upcoming elections. It's particularly relevant for individuals who have changed their address or have an expired ID.

## Procedure

1. Schedule an appointment at your nearest INE office online or via phone.
2. Prepare the required documents (proof of address, original ID, birth certificate).
3. Attend the appointment and submit your documents for verification.
4. Get your photograph and fingerprints taken.
5. Wait for your new Voter ID to be processed and mailed to you or pick it up from the INE office.


## Required documents

- Proof of address (utility bill, lease agreement)
- Original ID (previous Voter ID if available)
- Birth certificate
- CURP (Unique Population Registry Code)
