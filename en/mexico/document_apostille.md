## Description
### What is it?
An apostille is a certification that ensures your documents are recognized internationally in countries that are part of the Hague Apostille Convention. This service is crucial for validating the authenticity of documents such as birth certificates, academic transcripts, and marriage licenses when they are to be used abroad.

### Who needs it?
Ideal for anyone requiring official documents to be recognized internationallyâ€”students studying abroad, expats, individuals applying for dual citizenship or jobs overseas, and parents registering the birth of their child in a foreign country. Especially convenient for U.S. citizens in Mexico and those dealing with Russian documents in Argentina.

## Procedure

1. Step 1: Identify the document that needs to be apostilled.
2. Step 2: Obtain a certified copy of the document if the original is not available.
3. Step 3: Visit the relevant local government office or use an authorized online service to submit your document for apostille.
4. Step 4: Pay the required processing fee.
5. Step 5: Wait for the document to be processed and receive notification of completion.
6. Step 6: Collect the apostilled document from the office or receive it through mail/courier.


## Required documents

- Certified copy of the document (e.g., birth certificate, academic transcript)
- Valid ID of the applicant
- Proof of payment for the apostille fee

## Additional details

- Processing times can vary but generally take up to a few weeks.
- Ensure all documents are translated into the necessary language if required.
- Apostille only certifies the authenticity of the signature, seal, or stamp; it does not validate the content of the document.
- Some documents may need to be notarized before they can be apostilled.
