## Description
### What is it?
A driver's license is a legal document certifying that the individual holding it is qualified and authorized to drive certain types of motor vehicles. In the case of Romania, it's a requirement for any individual seeking to legally drive within the country.

### Who needs it?
Any individual who is of the legal driving age in Romania, that is, 18 years old, and wishes to drive motor vehicles within the country needs a Romanian driver's license.

## Procedure

2. At the end of the theoretical course, you will have to pass a theoretical exam (commonly known as the "theory test").
