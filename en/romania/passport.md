## Description
### What is it?
A Romanian passport is an official document issued by the Romanian government, allowing international travel to those holding Romanian citizenship.

### Who needs it?
Anyone born in Romania, has parents who are Romanian citizens, or has successfully gone through the Romanian naturalization procedure can apply for this travel document. 

## Procedure
To secure a Romanian passport, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have all the necessary documentation listed below.
2. Visit the Public Community Service for People's Record (SPCERP) in your locality or county.
3. Fill out the passport application form provided.
4. Pay the passport fee.
5. Wait for the specified timeframe for your passport processing.
6. Pick up your passport from the SPCERP.

## Required Documents
- Birth Certificate. It needs to be original, newly issued.
- National Identity Card. The ID should not be expired or damaged.
- Proof of payment for passport fees. This proof can be obtained once the fees are paid.

To gather these documents, consult with local Romanian authorities. If you're based outside of Romania, reach out to your nearest Romanian consulate or embassy.
