## Description
### What is it?
A work visa extension allows an individual to extend their stay in a given country beyond the limit of their initial work visa.

3. Gather the necessary documents for your application.
4. Submit your extension application at least 45 days before your current visa expires.
5. Pay the immigration fee for the extension.
6. Wait for the approval of your extension.
