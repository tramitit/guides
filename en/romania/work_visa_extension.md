## Description
### What is it?
A work visa extension allows an individual to extend their stay in a given country beyond the limit of their initial work visa.
### Who needs it?
This service is ideal for foreign individuals who are currently residing in Romania for work purposes and wish to extend their stay longer than their current work visa allows.

## Procedure
1. Understand your current visa status and know its expiration date.

3. Gather the necessary documents for your application.
4. Submit your extension application at least 45 days before your current visa expires.
5. Pay the immigration fee for the extension.
6. Wait for the approval of your extension.
