## Description
### What is it?
An Employment Contract is a legally binding agreement between an employer and employee. In Romania, such contracts are governed by the country's labor laws and outline the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of both parties involved.

### Who needs it?
Any organization or individual planning to hire an employee should create a proper Employment Contract. Moreover, if you are an individual planning to work in Romania, having a properly structured employment contract is necessary.

## Procedure 

1. Determine Employment: Decide on the nature of employment, whether the individual will be a full-time or part-time employee, contractor, or freelancer.

2. Specify the Basics: Include the basic details such as the individualâ€™s job title, duties and responsibilities, the remuneration, and the start date.

3. Outline Work Schedule: Describe the work schedule, including the number of work hours, breaks, and any overtime requirements.

4. Discuss Employment Benefits: Cover all employment benefits such as the health and pension programs, paid time offs, vacation leaves, sick days, and any additional perks your business might offer.

5. Understand Tax Responsibilities: Understand who is responsible for individual taxes in Romania, whether it's the company or the individual.

6. Include Confidential Clauses: Address confidential matters such as non-disclosure agreements and protection of intellectual property.

7. Agree on Contract Termination: Include details on how and when the contract could be terminated.

8. Legal Advice: Seek a lawyer's advice to check for any potential legal inconsistencies within the contract.

9. Finalize the Contract: Once all terms are agreed upon, have it signed by both the employee and the employer.

## Required Documents
- Proof of identification 
- Resume or CV: detailing an individual's professional and academic background
