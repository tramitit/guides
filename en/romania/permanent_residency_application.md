## Description
### What is it?
Permanent residency is a person's resident status in a country where they are not citizens. This status typically allows the person to reside and work indefinitely in the country where the status was granted.

### Who needs it?
Anyone intending to live and work indefinitely in a foreign country needs to undergo the Permanent Residency application process. This process varies from country to country and is typically subject to the immigration laws of the specific country.

## Procedure
1. Enquire with the embassy or consulate of the country where you intend to move to get precise details of the application process.
2. Determine the type of visa for which you want to apply. Your application type would depend on the reasons for your move: work, family, study etc.
3. Fill out the appropriate forms and collect all necessary documentation. This typically includes passport, birth certificates, proof of relationship (if applicable), medical records, police clearance, and financial support proof.
4. Submit application and documentation to the appropriate authority. You might be required to pay processing fees at this stage.

## Required Documents
Every country has different requirements, but you may need the following: 
1. A valid passport
2. Birth certificate
3. Marriage certificate or proof of relationship (if applicable)
4. Medical records
5. Police clearance
6. Proof of financial support
7. Any evidence of your proficiency in the local language, having a job, or other elements that would help you integrate might be beneficial.

Note that all the documents required for a PR visa application must be translated and certified, and in some instances, documents must also be apostilled.
