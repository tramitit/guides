## Description
### What is it?
A Certificate of Authenticity is a document that validates the authenticity of an item, usually a piece of artwork, piece of equipment, or valuable object. It includes details like the name of the artist or manufacturer, details about the item, the date it was created and its condition. 
### Who needs it?
Anyone looking to verify the authenticity of a valuable item. This might include collectors, buyers, sellers, or those looking to insure valuable items. 

## Procedure
1. Ensure your item is authentic and valuable enough to warrant a certificate.
2. Locate an expert who can evaluate your item and issue a certificate of authenticity. This could include an artist, manufacturer, a certified appraiser, or an appropriate industry expert.
3. The expert will examine your item for authenticity, considering the age, condition, materials used, and other factors that prove it is genuine.
4. Once the examination is done, the expert prepares a certificate of authenticity containing all pertinent information such as a description of the item, the date it was created, the name of the artist or manufacturer, and the expertâ€™s signature and contact information.

## Required Documents
Depending on your item and the expert you choose, you may need:
- Proof of purchase or provenance
- Photos of the item from multiple angles
