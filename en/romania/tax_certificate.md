## Description

### What is it?
A Tax Certificate or Certificat de Rezidență Fiscală, as it is known in Romania, is a document that shows your declared place of tax residency. It is often required when you want to open a brokerage account, handle large financial transactions, or when you plan to reside in a foreign country and need to show your tax status.

### Who needs it?
Anyone planning to move abroad for work or other bigger financial activities, like trading in stock markets through brokerage may need this certificate. 

## Procedure

1. Start by going to your local tax office or 'Agentia Nationala de Administrare Fiscala.' You can find your local tax office by visiting the [ANAF website](https://www.anaf.ro/).

2. Inform them that you need a Tax Certificate and fill the necessary form for filing request for tax certificate.

3. You need to declare all sources of income that you have. This will be assessed by ANAF and they will draw up your Tax Certificate.

4. After submitting your documents and request, you will need to wait for them to process your information and issue your Tax Certificate.

## Required Documents

You'll need the following documents:

1. Identification - ID or Passport
2. Document that shows your current address
3. Financial declarations for your income sources

## Additional details
The Tax Certificate is valid for a period of 12 months. Keep the issued tax certificate securely as you may need to provide that as proof of your tax residency status to various financial institutions and it might take some time to get replacement if lost.

Also, keep in my mind Tax rates might vary based on your income sources and amount, and it is advised to consult a Tax consultant or legal expert to have the clear understanding of your tax responsibilities.
