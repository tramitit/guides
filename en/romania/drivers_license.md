## Description
### What is it?
A driver's license is a legal document certifying that the individual holding it is qualified and authorized to drive certain types of motor vehicles. In the case of Romania, it's a requirement for any individual seeking to legally drive within the country.

### Who needs it?
Any individual who is of the legal driving age in Romania, that is, 18 years old, and wishes to drive motor vehicles within the country needs a Romanian driver's license.

## Procedure
1. Enroll in a driving school. The school will normally provide theoretical education course as well as practical driving lessons.
2. At the end of the theoretical course, you will have to pass a theoretical exam (commonly known as the "theory test").
3. After passing the theory test, your driving school will apply for your practical driving exam.
4. Once you pass the practical exam, you will be issued with a temporary driver's license.
5. The final, plastic driver's license card will be sent to your home address.

## Required Documents
- Proof of identity
- Medical certificate to prove your mental and physical fitness for driving. This can be obtained from a licensed medical institution.
- Proof of enrollment in a certified driving school.
