## Description
### What is it?
A lease agreement is a legal contract between a tenant and landlord for a specific period, outlining the terms and conditions of renting a property. 

### Who needs it?
The guide is essential for individuals intending to rent property in Romania such as apartments, houses, or commercial property. It's equally important for landlords looking to rent out their property.

## Procedure

1. First and foremost, decide on the property you want to rent and agree on the terms with the landlord. This includes the rent amount, the duration of the lease, among others.

2. Draft a preliminary contract of the lease agreement. You can [create the lease agreement](https://www.avocatnet.ro/articol/42059/Contractul-de-inchiriere-model-si-informatii-esentiale.html) yourself, hire a lawyer, or use online templates. The document needs to be written in the Romanian language to be legally binding.

3. Review the terms of the lease agreement carefully. Ensure all aspects and agreements are documented in writing.

4. Sign the lease agreement in the presence of a public notary who will authenticate the contract. Every lease agreement in Romania must be authenticated by a notary.

5. Lastly, register the lease agreement at the local Fiscal Administration office. This is a legal requirement in Romania for all lease contracts.

## Required Documents
