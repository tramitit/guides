## Description
### What is it?
A Vehicle Visa or vehicle registration is a documentation process that recognizes the legality and ownership of a vehicle under specific jurisdiction. It's a crucial requirement for any vehicle owner in Romania.

### Who needs it?
Anyone who owns a vehicle (used or new) in Romania, or anyone who has imported a car into Romania from another country.

## Procedure
1. First, you need to buy a car (either from Romania or another country). 
2. Upon purchase, ensure you receive a car sale contract (contract de vânzare-cumpărare), a certificate of deregistration (certificat de radiere) if the car is domestically bought or a Customs document 846 if imported.
3. Go to the local Public Finance Administration (Administrația Financiară) with the documents mentioned above and pay the car tax.
4. Afterwards, take the tax payment proof to the Community Public Service for Driving Licenses and Car Registrations (Serviciul Comunitar pentru Permise de Conducere și Înmatriculare a Vehiculelor) to register the car.

## Required Documents
- Identity document (passport or ID card)
- Proof of car sale (contract de vânzare-cumpărare)
- Certificate of deregistration (certificat de radiere) or Customs document 846
- Proof of car tax payment

## Additional details
- If the vehicle has been imported, insurance and vehicle pollution tax (impozitul auto pentru poluare) need to be paid as well.
- Please note that all the documents should be translated into Romanian.
- It’s best to consult professional help or specific service providers to assist in the process, especially in case of a language barrier or unfamiliarity with the Romanian bureaucracy.
