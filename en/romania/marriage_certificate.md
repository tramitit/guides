## Description
### What is it?
A marriage certificate is a document that officially records the union of two people. In Romania, it is issued by the civil status department of the City Hall where the marriage took place.

### Who needs it?
Anyone who has gotten married in Romania and needs official proof of their marriage will need a marriage certificate. It is especially important for legal matters, including visa applications and inheritance proceedings.

## Procedure

1. Prepare all necessary documents and submit them to the local city hall in the municipality where the marriage was performed.
2. The civil status department of the City Hall will issue the marriage certificate on the spot at the time of the ceremony.
3. If you need an apostille on the certificate for international use, submit the marriage certificate to the [Ministry of Public Administration and Justice](https://www.just.ro/).

## Required Documents

1. Birth Certificates of Bride and Groom (original and copy)
2. Identity Documents of Bride and Groom (original and copy)
3. Pre-marital medical examination certificates

For certificates to be recognized outside of Romania, you may need them apostilled. Contact the Ministry of Public Administration and Justice for this process.

## Additional details
When a Romanian citizen marries a foreigner, the marriage certificate needs to be transcribed to the Romanian authorities. The transcript of the marriage certificate happens at the city halls in Romania or at the Romanian Consular offices abroad.

For genealogical searches and obtaining old marriage records, you may need to consult with the civil status department, the National Archives in Bucharest, or various online genealogy resources.
