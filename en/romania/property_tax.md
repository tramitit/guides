### Who needs it?
Any individual or entity owning real estate properties such as houses, apartments or land needs to pay property tax. It is particularly crucial for property owners in Romania, as it is one of the European Union countries with relatively high property taxes.

1. Valuate the property based on the current market rates, possibly with the help of a professional.
2. Calculate the tax due based on the property value and the current tax rate. Ensure to consider tax exemptions if you are eligible.

There are also property taxes on luxury properties which you could be liable for depending on your property type.
Being aware of these tax allocations could help you manage your property tax payments more effectively in Romania.
