### What is it?
Citizenship confirmation is a process to prove your citizenship of a certain country. In this context, we are focusing on the Romanian and Moldovan citizenship confirmation process. It is essential if you plan on getting a passport, studying abroad, or opening a bank account.

### Who needs it?
People who have dual citizenship, people planning to work, study, or relocate to other countries, or people needing to prove their citizenship to financial institutions are ideal candidates for citizenship confirmation.
