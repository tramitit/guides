## Description
### What is it?
A building permit is an official approval needed to begin construction or remodeling activity in Romania. This ensures that the project plans comply with local standards for land use, zoning, and construction.

### Who needs it?

## Procedure
1. Identify if your project needs a permit according to local laws.
2. Prepare necessary documents such as detailed construction plans, site maps, property deeds, etc.
3. Submit your application to the local Council (Primaria). Applications usually entail a fee.
4. Your application will undergo an assessment from the Council's Urbanism and Architecture Department.
5. If approved, pay the permit fee and pick up your approved and stamped project.
