## Description
### What is it?
A building permit is an official approval needed to begin construction or remodeling activity in Romania. This ensures that the project plans comply with local standards for land use, zoning, and construction.

### Who needs it?
Any individual or company who intends to build a new structure, or to alter, repair, or demolish an existing building, within Romanian territory.

## Procedure
1. Identify if your project needs a permit according to local laws.
2. Prepare necessary documents such as detailed construction plans, site maps, property deeds, etc.
3. Submit your application to the local Council (Primaria). Applications usually entail a fee.
4. Your application will undergo an assessment from the Council's Urbanism and Architecture Department.
5. If approved, pay the permit fee and pick up your approved and stamped project.

- In addition to national regulations, local regulations can also apply. It's recommended to check with your local Council for specifics.
- Construction cannot be started until the stamped approved project along with the permit have been received.
- Permits have a validity period and construction must be started and concluded within that period.
- The legality of off-grid living arrangements, such as tiny homes, requires careful research into local and national building codes and zoning regulations.
- The permit application and procedure may vary depending on the nature and complexity of the construction project, including but not limited to residential, commercial, municipal, and infrastructure projects.
