## Description
### What is it?
A criminal record, also known as a 'cazier judiciar' in Romanian, is a record kept by the state regarding a person's criminal history. It includes details about any criminal convictions, fines, or other judicial decisions linked to that individual's name.

### Who needs it?
Anyone who is applying for a job, volunteering, or applying for a visa may be required to provide a criminal record check. It's especially important for people who are in or plan to work in roles that involve the care or safety of other individuals. 

## Procedure
1. Visit a police station in person. You may need to book an appointment beforehand. 
2. Bring your valid ID and any forms or documents required. In Romania, you may need to fill out a form that includes your personal data and reason for requesting the document. 
3. The officer will process your application. 
4. Depending on the system, you may receive the document automatically or you might need to wait for a few days or pick it up at a later date. 

## Required Documents
The documents required may vary from country to country, but typically you will need: 

1. Valid identification (such as a passport or ID card).
2. Application form (you can generally find a template online or get one at the police station).
