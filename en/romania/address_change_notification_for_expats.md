## Description
### What is it?
Changing the address notification is a crucial process for expatriates. It ensures that all relevant institutions, organizations, and services are aware of your new location.

### Who needs it?
This procedure is vital for expatriates who have moved to a new location, whether within the same country or to a different one. It is also useful for expats who frequently relocate due to their job or other factors.

## Procedure
1. Start by notifying your local embassy or consulate about your change of address. 
2. Update your address with all financial institutions you are linked to. This includes banks, credit card companies, and any money transfer services you might be using.
3. Notify governmental agencies such as the taxation and benefits departments of your home country.
4. Update your address for any subscriptions or online services like Netflix, Amazon, Gmail, etc.
5. Lastly, notify postal services and any home delivery services you use on a regular basis.

## Required Documents
You may need documents such as:
- Proof of your new address. This could be a lease agreement or utilities bill.
- Identification documents.
- Any legal documents related to your immigration status.
