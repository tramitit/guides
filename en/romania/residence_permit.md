## Description
### What is it?
A Residence Permit, also known as a Permis de Sedere, is a document that gives a foreign national permission to reside in a particular country for a specific duration. This guide will particularly focus on obtaining a Residence Permit in Romania.

### Who needs it?
A Residence Permit is necessary for non-EU nationals planning to live, work or study in Romania for a period exceeding 90 days.

## Procedure
1. Obtain a long-stay visa for Romania from the Romanian Embassy or Consulate in your home country. Apply for a visa type depending on the reason for your stay (work, studies, marriage, etc.). Visit the [official page of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs](http://www.mae.ro/en/node/2040) for more information.

2. Upon your entry in Romania, register your long-stay visa with the General Inspectorate for Immigration (IGI), within 30 days from the entry date.

3. Apply for the residence permit through IGI. The application can be submitted directly or mailed. The [IGI](http://igi.mai.gov.ro/d/66-permise-de-sedere) website offers official information.

4. Provide required documents (see document list below). You may be asked for the original documents and their photocopies.

5. Attend an interview at the IGI office. 

6. Upon approval, pay the residence permit fee.

## Required Documents
- Application form 
- Passport or travel document
