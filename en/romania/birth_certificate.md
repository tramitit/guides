## Description
### What is it?
A birth certificate is an important personal document that records the birth of an individual. It usually includes details like the full name of the individual, the date and location of birth, and the names of the parents.

### Who needs it?
It is universally required for official purposes such as school enrollment, obtaining a passport, government services, among others. Individuals born in Romania or those with Romanian heritage who wish to establish their birth record, regardless of their current residency, may need to obtain a birth certificate from Romania.

## Procedure
1. Begin by contacting the Romanian Civil Status Directorate or the local town hall in the city where the birth was registered. 
2. Present the necessary documentation and proof of identity. 
3. If applicable, a legal representative or family member can make the petition on behalf of the person needing the birth certificate. 
4. Depending on the circumstances, an appointment may be given to visit the office or the process might be initiated remotely.

## Required Documents
The documents required can vary, but generally include:
1. Valid Identification: A passport or any government-issued ID that can verify your identity and your relation to the person on the birth certificate.
2. Proof of Relation or Legal Interest: For individuals requesting on behalf of someone else, documents to prove the nature of the relationship or legal interest in acquiring the certificate.
3. Fee Payment: Some establishments may require payment for the copy of the certificate.
