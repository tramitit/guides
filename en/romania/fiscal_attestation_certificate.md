## Description
### What is it?
A Fiscal Attestation Certificate is a document that confirms a person's tax status and residency. It is often used for legal processes, purchases, and applications in Romania and other countries.

### Who needs it?
The Fiscal Attestation Certificate is primarily needed by residents, non-residents living in the country for a certain period, or business entities wishing to provide proof of their tax status or residency.

## Procedure
1. Determine which type of Fiscal Attestation Certificate you require. This will generally depend on your specific needs, as well as your residency status.
2. Gather necessary documents such as proof of assignment activities, proof of income and, sometimes, proof of tax payment.
3. Apply through the tax authority's website or physical office. The application will require you to fill out specific forms.
4. Once the application gets approved, pay the necessary fees.
5. The certificate will be issued either electronically or in a hard copy, depending on the country and your preference.
