## Description
### What is it?
An Urbanism Certificate is a certifying document for any project requiring construction, zoning, or other land-use changes and permits. The certificate signifies that you have complied with all the zoning rules and urban planning laws specific to your region or country.

### Who needs it?
Any individual or entity intending to start urban development projects,  buying, selling, or building on the land, or intending to make changes in the usage of land would require an Urbanism Certificate.

## Procedure

1. Figure out the zoning of the land you own or intend to purchase. This will help you understand what can be built on it.
2. Apply for the Urbanism Certificate from the local Town Hall (PrimÄƒria). You should get a written response within 30 days from the filing date.
3. If your application is approved, you will receive an Urbanism Certificate, indicating that your project meets the zoning requirements.
4. If your project requires construction or changes in the existing structures, you will need to submit a construction permit application.
5. Finally, once the construction permit is approved by the local authorities, you can begin your project.

## Required Documents

The documentation requirements may vary according to the local laws, but the following is a general list of documents required:

- Application form
- Proof of property ownership
- Site plan
- Project plan 
- Environmental impact assessment (if required)

Moreover, the cost of obtaining the certificate and other permits may vary based on the size and nature of your project. It's always advisable to seek proper legal help ahead of time to avoid potential hiccups. Also, patience is key as these processes can often take longer than anticipated.
