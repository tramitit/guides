## Description
### What is it?
A Tax Identification Number (TIN) is a unique identifier assigned by a tax authority to a taxpayer. This may be assigned by a national taxation agency or a federal government, depending on the country.

### Who needs it?
Anyone who is earning income and liable to pay taxes within their respective country. This includes residents, non-residents who have tax obligations, and businesses.

## Procedure

1. First, you need to contact your local tax office. The specific office will depend on your country and sometimes even your city. In France, this would be the [Service des Impots](https://www.impots.gouv.fr/portail/)

2. You may be required to provide certain supporting documents to verify your identity. This varies by country but typically includes proof of identity, such as a passport or national ID card, and proof of residence.

3. The tax office should then provide you with the appropriate application forms to fill out. Make sure to fill in the forms thoroughly and accurately.

4. Once you've completed and returned the forms, your tax office will then process your application. This can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, depending on your specific tax office and the volume of applications they are dealing with.

5. Once your application has been approved, your tax office will issue your TIN. Safeguard this number as it used to track your tax obligations and payments.

## Required Documents

- Proof of identity (e.g., Passport, National ID)
- Proof of residence

(Note: Requirements can vary substantially by country. Contact your local tax office for a definitive list)
