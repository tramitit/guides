## Description
### What is it?
Birth Certificate Registration refers to the process of officially recording the birth of a child in Romania, especially for expats or for those with Romanian descent living abroad.
### Who needs it?
Expatriate parents having a baby in Romania, or individuals with Romanian descent who were born abroad and seek to obtain Romanian citizenship, will need to register the birth.

## Procedure
1. Collect the essential documents. These will include documentation concerning the parents' identification and citizenship status.
2. If the birth is happening in Romania, you need to register it at the local City Hall ('Primaria') where the child was born within 30 days.
3. For births happening outside Romania, you need to register the birth with the nearest Romanian embassy or consulate.
4. If parents are of Romanian heritage but the birth took place outside Romania, you need to prove Romanian descent.

## Required Documents
- Identification documents of the parents
- Marriage certificate of the parents, if applicable
- Birth certificates of the parents, especially if proving Romanian descent
- Evidence of residence

To obtain these documents, it's advised to contact the relevant issuing authorities in your home country or Romania as applicable.

## Additional details
If you are claiming Romanian citizenship through descent, you need to provide clear evidence of Romanian heritage. It's advised to start this process early, as it may take substantial time due to the need for various documents and possible translation needs. Additionally, certificates need to be apostilled or legalised, depending on the issuing country. It's always recommended to check with Romanian authorities or legal advisors for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
