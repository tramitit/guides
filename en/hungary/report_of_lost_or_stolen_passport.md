## Additional details
- It is recommended to keep copies of your passportâ€™s biographic information page and the page containing your Hungarian entry stamp separately from your passport just in case it gets lost.
- Depending on when and where you lose your passport, the process to replace it can be time-consuming. It's best to start the process as soon as you realize your passport is missing.
- Remember to alert your airline or travel company about your situation. They may need to modify your return ticket or know about your situation for other reasons.
