## Description
### What is it?
The process of requesting a marriage certificate in Hungary involves retrieving records from official repositories, which contain details about the marriage of individual(s).

### Who needs it?
This service is necessary for those who need to validate marital status for legal proceedings, heritage, genealogy research or citizenship application by descent in Hungary.

## Procedure

1. Identify the correct church or entity where the marriage was likely registered pre-1895 as Hungarian civil registration of births, marriages, and deaths started in October 1895.
2. Learning Hungarian to read the documents or hiring a translator might be needed as most of these documents are written in Hungarian.
3. Contact the church directly as they likely hold the records or can guide you to the correct repository.
4. Apply to church or relevant authority for the marriage certificate by presenting the necessary details such as full names of individuals involved, date of marriage, place.
5. Be prepared to pay a fee for the search and issuing of the certificate. The cost usually varies.

## Required Documents
- Full names of the couple.
- Dates or approximations needed: birth, marriage, death.
- Parishes or addresses of relevance.
- Proof of relationship might be required in some cases.
