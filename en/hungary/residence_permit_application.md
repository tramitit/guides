A residence permit is an authorization that allows foreign nationals to stay in Hungary for a specified period. There are different types of residence permits, but these instructions mainly pertain to the "other purposes" residence permit, which is applicable to digital nomads and individuals who can sustain themselves without needing employment in the country.

### Who needs it?

## Additional details
Some foreigners who do not need a visa for travelling in Schengen Zone (e.g. US citizens) can apply for their residence permit in Hungary, while staying there as tourists. Others need to apply for a D-type visa first to enter Hungary, where they can switch to a residence permit. Those seeking to open a bank account in Hungary will need to wait until their permit is approved.

Please keep in mind that the decision ultimately lies with the Hungarian authorities and the process can be subjective, so it's advisable to consult with local experts or attorneys. Make sure you have all the required documents and understand the procedure well.
