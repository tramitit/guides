## Description
### What is it?
A personal income tax refund request is a claim made by a taxpayer to get back excess money paid towards income tax. A refund arises in situations where the amount of tax paid by a person is greater than the amount which he/she is supposed to pay.

### Who needs it?
Every individual taxpayer who has overpaid income taxes during a financial year is eligible to seek a tax refund.

## Procedure
1. Start by gathering all your financial income documents that show taxes withheld. These documents can include wage and earning statement(s) (W-2, W-2G, 1099-R,1099-Misc) and any other forms relevant to your earnings.
2. You will need to calculate your tax liability to understand if you have overpaid taxes.
3. File your income tax return online or via paper form. You can use an online tax software program or seek the services of a tax professional.
4. If you overpaid, the form will guide you in calculating your refund.
5. Submit the information through an official local tax portal or mail if you are making a paper submission.
6. Wait for a response, which may take a few weeks depending on the processing speed of your tax authority.

Please note that the process might slightly vary based on your country's tax rules and regulations.

## Required Documents
- W-2 form
- Personal identification number
- Bank account information
- Other relevant income and tax documents

Documents may vary somewhat depending on the local tax laws.

## Additional details
In some countries like the Netherlands, taxpayers can file for a tax return or refund on certain types of property taxes (onroerende zaken). The process will be different depending on the country and the type of tax, so make sure to refer to your local or national tax authority website for accurate information. It's also important to note that tax preparation services often have a cost, but they can simplify the process and make sure your return is filled out correctly.
