## Description
### What is it?
The state pension system is a government-run retirement provision for citizens. It is funded by compulsory contributions from workers and employers. Upon reaching a certain age, individuals who have contributed for a certain period start receiving regular pension payments from the state.

### Who needs it?
Any working individual who intends to have provision for retirement should be part of the state pension system. It is particularly vital for individuals who do not have or cannot afford private pension schemes.

## Procedure
1. Determine your eligibility for the state pension.
2. Sign up with your employer: As part of your employment contract, you should be automatically enrolled into the state pension system.
3. Ensure the deduction: Confirm that your employer is deducting the correct pension contributions from your salary.
4. Consistently contribute: Make sure your contribution to the state pension system is ongoing and consistent, as the amount you receive upon retirement will be determined by how much, and for how long, you contributed.

## Required Documents
Typically, you will need:
- An Identification: Valid ID or Passport.
- Proof of Employment: This could be your work contract or payslips.

## Additional details
Length of mandatory pension contribution varies depending on the country and specific retirement plans. Also, it's crucial to note that changing employment doesn't influence your state pension; your contributions are cumulative across all your years of work, regardless of how many employers you have had. You should ensure your contributions are accurately recorded, as mistakes could cost you in your pension payments.
