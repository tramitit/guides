## Description
### What is it?
A death certificate is a legal document issued by the government, which declares the cause of death, location of death, time of death and some other personal information about the deceased.

### Who needs it?
Family members or legal representatives usually need it for various reasons including claiming life insurance, inheriting property, or for genealogy research.

## Procedure
1. Identify the needed information i.e., Full name of the deceased, date of birth, date of death and place of death.
2. Visit Hungaryâ€™s central registry for death certificates [NYAK](https://nyak.gov.hu/). 
3. Submit your request and provide the necessary information.
4. Pay the fee for the service.
5. The death certificate will be produced. The waiting time depends largely on the year of death.

## Required Documents
1. Identification proof of the person making the request.
2. Proof of relationship to the deceased.
3. Information about the deceased's death.

## Additional details
If the person died before 1895, church records are often used as they often contain death records. The church records can be found in the [FamilySearch](https://familysearch.org/search/collection/show#uri=http://familysearch.org/searchapi/search/collection/1452460) database.

For genealogy research, it's important to note that private data like exact date of birth, place of birth, parents' names etc. are not handed out or confirmed by any Hungarian authority due to privacy law unless you can prove your legitimate interest. Even if you are a direct relative, the procedure can be tiresome and time-consuming.
