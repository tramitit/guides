## Description
### What is it?
Death registration is a formal recording of a person's demise by the government authority. It's a vital process that officially certifies the fact of death and provides important details like date, cause, and location of death.

### Who needs it?
Anyone responsible for reporting a death in Hungary, such as relatives, executor of the deceased's will, or hospital or care home officials need to register the death. It's an important step in managing the affairs of the deceased person. 

## Procedure
1. Gather all necessary documents related to the deceased, including: a medical certificate of death, the deceased's identification (passport, national ID card), and any other relevant documents.
2. In Hungary, death is typically registered in the deceased's place of residence. Therefore, visit the local Registry Office (Korm√°nyablak) to submit documents and report the death. 
3. The official will process the documents and you'll receive the death certificate, which provides legal proof of the death.

## Required Documents
- Medical certificate of death: This is provided by a doctor who can certify the death. In a hospital setting, this is usually the attending doctor. 
- The deceased's identification documents: This can include their passport, national ID card, and residence card.

## Providers that can do it for you

There may not be providers who can complete this entire process on your behalf, as it often requires personal attendance. However, for researching historical death records or obtaining certified copies of death certificates for genealogical purposes, there are providers who can assist.
