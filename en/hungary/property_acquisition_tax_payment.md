## Description
### What is it?
Property Acquisition Tax is a one-time tax obligation that property buyers are required to pay in Hungary when they acquire property. The tax rate varies from 2% to 4% of the property's market value. 

### Who needs it?
This obligation affects anyone who is purchasing a property in Hungary. This includes Hungarian nationals as well as international individuals and entities interested in owning property in Hungary.

## Procedure

1. Obtain a fair market valuation for the property you intend to purchase. This is usually done by a certified real estate appraiser.

2. Review tax rates based on the location and value of the property. The relevant tax rates can be found on the [Hungarian Tax and Customs Administration website](https://nav.gov.hu/).

3. Calculate your Property Acquisition Tax obligation by applying the appropriate rate to the market value of the property.

4. Upon acquiring the property, register the property with the local land registry.
