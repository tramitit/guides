## Description
### What is it?
Name change registration is the official procedure of legally changing and registering your new name with the relevant authorities in Hungary. It applies to changes in both first names and last names.

### Who needs it?
Ideal for residents or citizens in Hungary who wish to alter their legal name for any reason, such as marriage, divorce, personal choice or to better reflect cultural heritage.

## Procedure
1. Fill out the name change application form, listing both your current name and proposed new name.
2. Gather all the necessary supporting documents.
3. Submit your application and necessary documents to your local registry office.
4. Pay the name change application fee.
5. Once your application is approved, your new name will be registered and official documents will be issued to you.

Please be advised to check and follow up with the appropriate governmental department for any changes to this procedure.

## Required Documents
To ensure a smooth application process, you will need to provide the following documents:
1. Your current valid identification document (ID or passport)
2. Proof of residence (utility bill or similar)
3. Any relevant supporting documents that justify why you want to change your name (marriage certificate, divorce decree, or a letter explaining personal reasons)

Remember to always bring the original documents as well as photocopies. You should also keep in mind that the authorities might require additional documents depending on your specific case.
