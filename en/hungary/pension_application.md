## Description
### What is it?
A comprehensive guide to applying for a pension in Hungary. It covers all official procedures, required documents, and even professional providers that can facilitate the process.

### Who needs it?
This guide is beneficial for any individual approaching retirement age in Hungary or for expatriates planning to retire in Hungary.

## Procedure
1. Start planning for your pension well in advance. It's recommended to start preparing at least two years prior to your anticipated retirement date.
   
2. Gather all the documents listed below under "Required Documents".

3. Fill out the pension application form (Nyugdíjigénylés). This form can be obtained at your local government office or online from [Hungary's Central Administration of National Pension Insurance](https://onkormanyzat.munka.hu/Lapok/default.aspx) website.

4. Submit the application form along with your supporting documents to your local government office. 

5. Await feedback. The Hungarian government will notify you once your application has been processed. This could take several months, so it's best to apply as early as possible.

## Required Documents
- Proof of Identity (e.g passport, ID card)
- Proof of Residence in Hungary
- Employment history records demonstrating the required contribution period. You can obtain these from your past/present employers and the [National Insurance Institute](https://onkormanyzat.munka.hu/Lapok/fooldal.aspx).

## Additional details
While submitting your application, inquire about the different types of pensions available (e.g. old-age pension, disability pension, etc.) and determine which is best suitable for your situation. As an expatriate, you may also want to explore tax implications and consult with a tax expert.
 
Please note that the age of retirement in Hungary can vary. As of 2022, the retirement age in Hungary is 65 for both men and women. However, it's scheduled to gradually increase to 68 years by 2022. Always check the latest regulations.

If possible, seek out assistance from professionals or individuals who have gone through the same process. This will ensure that no important steps are missed and that the process runs smoothly.
