## Description
### What is it?
A Marriage Certificate Application in Hungary is a legal procedure which allows individuals to solemnize their marriage and obtain a legally recognized certificate. This document primarily serves as proof of marriage, which is often required for bureaucratic procedures both locally and internationally.

### Who needs it?
The process is aimed at individuals who are planning to get married in Hungary or those who have wedded in Hungary and require a certified copy of their marriage certificate.

## Procedure
1. Gather the required documents. These typically include birth certificates, proof of residency, identification documents, etc.
2. Contact your local registry office in Hungary. You can either reach out to them by calling, visiting their office, or through their online portal (if available). A list of local registry offices can usually be found on the official government website.
3. Submit the required documents alongside the application form. The form can usually be downloaded beforehand from the registry office's website.
4. Pay the required application fee. The exact cost may vary depending on the specific registry office.
5. Wait for the processing of your application. The time taken can vary and it is recommended to contact the registry office again if the certificate does not arrive after a significant amount of time has passed.
6. After approval, collect your Marriage Certificate from the registry office or have it delivered to your designated address.

## Required Documents
- Birth certificates
- Identification documents such as passports or identity cards
- Proof of residency
- Divorce documents or death certificate of former spouse (if applicable)
