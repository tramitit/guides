## Description
### What is it?
Getting married in Hungary involves both a civil and a church ceremony. To legalize the union, the couple must undergo a civil ceremony conducted by the Municipality. They can opt to have a church ceremony afterward. 

### Who needs it?
This guide is ideal for Hungarian citizens, residents, and foreigners who wish to get married in Hungary. 

## Procedure
1. Notify the local government office: This should be done at least 30 days before the intended marriage date. You can find the list of local government offices [here](https://www.kormanyhivatal.hu/hu/budapest/fokapcsolat/tajekoztato).

2. Submit Required Documents: You need to provide all the necessary documents (listed below) to the local government office.   

3. Civil Ceremony: Schedule a date for the civil ceremony that will legalize the marriage.

## Required Documents
- Proof of identity (birth certificate, passport, or residence permit).
- If one or both of you are not Hungarian citizens, you must provide a Certificate of No Impediment to prove that you are legally free to marry. This can be obtained from your country's embassy in Hungary.

## Additional details
- The procedure may vary slightly for foreigners or non-residents. Hence, it is advised to consult with the local government office or a legal advisor familiar with Hungarian marriage laws.
- Once the civil ceremony is completed, you can then proceed with religious or other ceremonial traditions as you wish. But remember, only the civil procedure is legally binding in Hungary.
- Consider having the documents translated into Hungarian to prevent any communication misunderstandings.
