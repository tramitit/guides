## Description
### What is it?
Request for refugee status is a formal application process where an individual who is unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, applies for protection in another country.

### Who needs it?
Any individual or group of individuals who face severe threats, persecution, and violence in their home country and are unable or unwilling to return due to the threats posed to their life and safety.

## Procedure
1. Arrival in a Safe Country: The first step in seeking refugee status is to arrive in a safe country, such as Hungary.

2. Initial Registration: The initial registration involves the provision of biometric data, an interview to establish the basic facts of the case, and filling out a questionnaire to collect more detailed information.

3. Submission of the Application: After registration, the formal application for refugee status is submitted to the competent authorities. This includes all documents and evidence supporting your claim. 

4. Interview: An in-person interview is generally required to assess your credibility, and to discuss in detail the circumstances leading to your departure from your home country. 

5. Decision: The authorities will issue a decision after a thorough examination. If granted refugee status, you'll receive a residence permit allowing you to reside legally in the country.

## Required Documents
- Valid passport or travel documents 
- Evidence supporting your claim, including any reports, photos, or documents from your home country that can corroborate your fear of persecution 
- Completed questionnaire 
- Any identity or travel documents issued by UNHCR or another country
