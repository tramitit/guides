## Description
### What is it?
Sick pay is a type of workforce benefit where employees are paid even when they take time off due to illness. Different countries and companies have varying regulations regarding sick pay.

### Who needs it?
Any employee who needs to take some time off work due to illness could benefit from understanding how to apply for sick pay, in order to ensure income continuity during their recuperation period.

## Procedure
1. If you become sick, the first step would be to inform your employer as soon as possible. This is generally done via a sick letter or Krankenschein in Germany. 
   
2. Depending on your workplace's policy and location, you may need to see a doctor and get a medical certificate attesting your condition. For example, in Hungary, once you've obtained a medical certificate, the doctor will usually submit it electronically.

3. Once you've notified your employer and obtained the necessary medical documentation, check with your employer or human resources department to see if there is a specific sick pay request form you need to fill out.

4. Complete the form as required and submit, including attaching any necessary medical documentation.

5. Await for your employer or the human resources department to approve the sick pay. The timelines may vary depending on your workplace policy.

## Required Documents
- Sick letter or medical certificate from a doctor
