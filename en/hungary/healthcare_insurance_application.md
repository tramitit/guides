## Description
### What is it?
Healthcare insurance application refers to the process of applying for a health insurance policy. This policy provides coverage for various medical expenses incurred by the policyholder.

### Who needs it?
Healthcare insurance can benefit anyone, and it's particularly important for expats, students, or anyone planning to reside in Hungary for an extended period of time as public healthcare may be limited.

## Procedure

1. Research various healthcare insurance providers active in Hungary and select one that suits your needs. 
2. Fill in the application form provided by the selected health insurance provider. This form usually requests personal, financial, and health related information.
3. Submit the filled out application form.
4. Wait for approval. The approval process can take several days to a few weeks, depending on the provider and your individual circumstances.
5. Once approved, you will likely need to pay a premium for the policy to activate.
