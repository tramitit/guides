## Description
### What is it?
This guide details how you can request an official pre-1895 birth certificate from Hungary.

### Who needs it?
This process is particularly useful for individuals seeking to trace their family heritage or apply for Hungarian citizenship by descent. 

## Procedure
1. Start by identifying the relevant church where the individual was baptized or the birth was officially recorded. This will most likely be based on the individual's faith and the geographical location.

2. Contact the church or parish office to inquire about accessing historical records. Depending on the church, you may be able to request this information via phone or email.

3. Fill out any official forms or paperwork required by the church to access the records.

4. Pay any fees associated with accessing these records. 

Please note that these steps may significantly vary or additional steps may be required depending on the specific church or parish's procedures.

## Required Documents
While there may be variance depending on the church, you will likely need:

- Proof of your identity and your relationship to the individual whose birth certificate you are requesting.
- Details about the individual including name, date of birth, parents' names and location of birth.

## Additional details
Accessing historical birth records requires patience, as it can be a time-consuming process. It's also important to note that in some cases, records may not be available due to events such as fires, wars, or general loss over time. If this is the case, you may need to research alternative archeological methods to trace your genealogy. For individuals seeking Hungarian citizenship by descent, obtaining such documents is a crucial part of proving your eligibility.
