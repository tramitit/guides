### Who needs it?
This process is particularly useful for individuals seeking to trace their family heritage or apply for Hungarian citizenship by descent. 

## Procedure
1. Start by identifying the relevant church where the individual was baptized or the birth was officially recorded. This will most likely be based on the individual's faith and the geographical location.

## Additional details
Accessing historical birth records requires patience, as it can be a time-consuming process. It's also important to note that in some cases, records may not be available due to events such as fires, wars, or general loss over time. If this is the case, you may need to research alternative archeological methods to trace your genealogy. For individuals seeking Hungarian citizenship by descent, obtaining such documents is a crucial part of proving your eligibility.
