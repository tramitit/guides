## Description
### What is it?
A student loan is a type of loan designed to help students pay for post-secondary education and the associated fees, such as tuition, books and supplies, and living expenses. 

### Who needs it?
It is ideally designed for students who require financial aid to cover their education expenses.

## Procedure
1. Identify if you need a student loan: Estimate your education-related expenses and subtract any existing sources of income or savings.
2. Research on different lenders: Look into factors such as interest rates, repayment options, loan terms and conditions.
3. Check your eligibility: Most loans require you to be enrolled at least half-time in an eligible degree or certificate program.
4. Fill out the application form: Most loan applications require detailed financial information, so be prepared with all relevant documents.
5. Evaluate the loan offer: Review the terms and conditions before accepting any loan offer. Make sure you understand the repayment terms.
6. Accept the loan: Once you accept the loan, funds are generally disbursed directly to the school.

## Required Documents
- Proof of Identity (like driver’s license, passport)
- Social Security number

## Additional details
- Interest rates can be fixed or variable and the rate usually depends on the credit history of the borrower or co-signer.
- There’s a limit on the total amount you can borrow, known as the cost of attendance.
- A co-signer with strong credit can increase the likelihood of loan approval and may lower the interest rate.
- Be mindful of any late payment or default consequences.
- Before you take out a private student loan, make sure to take advantage of any grants, scholarships, or work-study opportunities.
- Make sure to keep all documentation related to your student loan as it can come in handy later.
