## Description
### What is it?
A Sole proprietorship is a type of enterprise that is owned and run by a single person and in which there is no legal distinction between the owner and the business entity.

## Additional details

Before registering your sole proprietorship, it's essential to understand the liability you are assuming as the sole owner. In the eyes of the law, your business and you as an individual are the same thing, so any business debts or liabilities are also your personal debts and liabilities. This often includes financial obligations and any legal actions taken against your business.

On the positive side, sole proprietorships are much easier and less costly to set up compared to other business structures. They are also subject to fewer regulations which could benefit businesses in their early stages.
