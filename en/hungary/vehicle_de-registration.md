## Description
### What is it?
Vehicle de-registration involves removing your vehicle's information from the official public records. This process is typically undertaken when the vehicle is permanently taken out of service, for example, due to exportation, selling, or disposing of the vehicle.

### Who needs it?
If you are moving out of the country, selling your vehicle, or no longer using your vehicle in Hungary, you will need to go through this de-registration process.

2. You have to bring along the car's documents, including the car's registration certificate and license plates in order to de-register it.
3. Visit any official vehicle registration office (Okmányiroda) to submit these.
4. Finally, you need to fill and submit appropriate forms and make necessary payments. 

## Required Documents
1. Registration Certificate of the vehicle
2. License plates of the vehicle
