## Description
### What is it?
This is a guide designed to help streamline the process of applying for Hungarian citizenship through simplified naturalization or by descent.

### Who needs it?
People who have Hungarian ancestry and wish to relocate to Hungary, or simply to have a European Union passport.

## Procedure
1. Determine if you are eligible. You need to have at least one ancestor who was a Hungarian citizen, and you must have some proficiency in the Hungarian language.

2. Start learning Hungarian if you don't already speak it. The citizenship application requires a basic level of language proficiency.

3. Trace your family tree to find your Hungarian ancestors. You will need documents to prove that they were Hungarian citizens.

4. Gather documents to prove your Hungarian ancestry.

5. Translate all necessary documents into Hungarian. Official translations are required.

6. Submit your application at the nearest Hungarian consulate or embassy. 

7. Pass an interview in Hungarian at the consulate or embassy. You will be quizzed on basic Hungarian language skills and perhaps even a little Hungarian history. The process is largely in Hungarian. 

## Required Documents
* Proof of identity such as a passport.
* Proof of residence.
* Birth certificates, marriage certificates, death certificates that prove your lineage to your Hungarian ancestor.
* Documents proving proficiency in Hungarian language.
* Proof of good conduct.
