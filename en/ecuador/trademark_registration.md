## Description
### What is it?
Trademark registration in Ecuador involves securing your brand's name, logo, or other identifiers for exclusive use in the commerce sector. This protection ensures that only you can use your registered trademarks in your specific market, helping to prevent unauthorized use or infringement by others.

### Who needs it?
This service is ideal for businesses and entrepreneurs launching new products or brands in Ecuador who want to protect their intellectual property. It's also crucial for existing businesses planning to expand and those looking to differentiate their goods or services in a competitive market.

## Procedure

1. Conduct a preliminary trademark search to ensure availability.
2. Prepare and file the trademark application with the Ecuadorian Institute of Intellectual Property (IEPI).
3. Pay the required application fees.
4. Wait for the examination and publication period for any oppositions (approximately 4-6 months).
5. If no oppositions, receive the registration certificate and start using the Â® symbol.
