## Description
### What is it?
In Portugal, there is no traditional credit score system. Instead, the Central de Responsabilidades de Crédito (CRC) managed by Banco de Portugal holds information about individuals' credit responsibilities, including any defaults or active credits. Credit cards are financial tools that allow borrowing funds within a preset limit for purchases or cash advances.

### Who needs it?
Understanding your CRC report is essential for anyone seeking loans or credit cards. It helps financial institutions assess your creditworthiness. Credit cards offer convenience for transactions and can help build a credit history.

## Procedure
1. Apply for a CRC Report: Applications for CRC reports can be made through [Banco de Portugal’s website](https://www.bportugal.pt/area-cidadao/formulario/227). Credit card applications can be made online through individual banks.
2. Provide Necessary Documents: These usually include proof of identity (e.g., ID card, passport), proof of address (e.g., utility bills, rent agreement), and financial information.

## Required Documents
Commonly required documents include:

- Proof of Identity (ID Card, Passport)
- Proof of Address (Utility bills, Rent agreement)
- Proof of Income (Payslips, tax returns)

You can obtain your CRC report from Banco de Portugal or apply for credit cards through financial institutions.
