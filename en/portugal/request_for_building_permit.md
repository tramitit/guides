## Description
### What is it?
A building permit is a required legal document in Portugal, which you must obtain before carrying out any construction or renovation work on a property. It ensures that your project complies with the local zoning laws, environmental regulations, and safety standards.
### Who needs it?
Anyone who plans to carry out construction activities in Portugal - be it homeowners wanting to renovate, property developers planning to build, or businesses looking to expand.

## Procedure
1. Initial research: Identify the zoning and requirements of the area where the building is located. This can be found at local municipality websites.
   
2. Design documentation: Have a certified architect or engineer draft the project design adhering to the local laws and environmental regulations.
   
3. Application: Apply at the local municipality for the permit. The application should include the building plans, a site plan, and other requested documentation.
   
4. Review: The municipality will review the application and supporting documents. This process may take several weeks.
   
5. Approval: Once the review is complete, you will receive notification of approval or denial. If approved, the permit will be issued, and construction can commence following the terms of the permit.
