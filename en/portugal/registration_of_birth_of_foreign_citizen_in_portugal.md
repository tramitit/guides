## Description
### What is it?
It refers to the process through which a non-Portuguese newborn child can be registered in Portugal, in effect becoming a Portuguese citizen.
### Who needs it?
This service is necessary for parents who are foreign citizens but wish to register their child's birth in Portugal. This might be because they are living in the country, because one or both parents have Portuguese nationality, or they wish to apply for Portuguese citizenship for their child. 

## Procedure

2. Prepare all necessary documents (as detailed below).
3. Submit the completed form and documents to the Portuguese Consulate or directly at the Central Registry Office in Portugal.

## Required Documents
- Proof of identity of parents (Passport or Identity Card).
- Birth certificates of parents.
- Marriage certificate of parents if married (If applicable).
- Birth certificate of the child issued by the relevant authority in the country of birth. Note: this must be international or multilingual, or translated into Portuguese by a certified translator.
