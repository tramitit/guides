## Description
### What is it?
A debt certificate is a document that confirms the existing debts of an individual or entity. A no-debt certificate, on the other hand, is a document certifying that there are no outstanding debts/liabilities against an individual or entity.

### Who needs it?
These certificates can be beneficial for individuals in financial planning, debt management, and loan applications. It may also be required by companies during due diligence or audits.

## Procedure
1. Determine the issuing authority: Find out which authority or organization you need to approach to get this certificate. It could be a financial institution, a government organization, or a credit rating agency, depending on your location.
2. Apply for the Certificate: Most issuing authorities have an application form that needs to be filled. You may be required to apply online or in person.
3. Provide necessary documents: Provide any required documents as proof of your identity and financial transactions. In most cases, this would include identity proof, address proof, and details of your financial transactions.

## Required Documents
