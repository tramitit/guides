## Description
### What is it?
IRS Anexo A is a supplementary form that taxpayers must fill out when declaring their income for tax purposes in Portugal. This annex is specifically used for declaring income from employment, including salaries, wages, bonuses, and other related compensations.

### Who needs it?
Any individual residing in Portugal who has employment income must fill out IRS Anexo A as part of their annual tax declaration. This includes both Portuguese nationals and foreign residents who have earned income from employment within the country.

## Procedure
1. **Gather Necessary Documents**: Before you start filling out IRS Anexo A, ensure you have all relevant documents, such as your salary slips, employment contracts, and other evidence of income.
   
2. **Access the IRS Portal**: Go to the [Portuguese Tax Authority's official website (Portal das Finanças)](https://www.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt).

3. **Login to Your Account**: Use your login credentials (NIF and password) to access your account on the portal.
   
4. **Navigate to the IRS Section**: Once logged in, go to the IRS (Imposto sobre o Rendimento de Pessoas Singulares) section to start your annual tax declaration process.
   
5. **Select the Fiscal Year**: Choose the fiscal year for which you are filing the taxes. Ensure it's the correct year to avoid any discrepancies.

6. **Select IRS Form Model 3**: You will need to fill in Modelo 3, which is the standard form for declaring personal income tax in Portugal.
   
7. **Include Anexo A**: Within Modelo 3, there will be an option to add Anexo A. Select it to begin filling out the supplementary details of your employment income.
   
8. **Fill in Income Details**: Enter all required information, including your gross income, any bonuses, and other compensations received during the fiscal year.
   
9. **Declare Withholding Taxes**: Report the amount of tax already withheld by your employer. This is usually detailed on your salary slips.
   
10. **Review and Submit**: Carefully review all the filled-in information to ensure accuracy. Once confirmed, submit your tax declaration electronically through the portal.

## Required Documents
- **Salary Slips**: Monthly payslips provided by your employer, detailing your gross income and tax withheld.
- **Employment Contracts**: Documents that outline your employment terms and salary.
- **Annual Income Statement**: Provided by your employer, summarizing your earnings for the year.
