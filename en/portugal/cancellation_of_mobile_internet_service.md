## Description
### What is it?
Cancelling your mobile internet service is a process that involves informing your internet service provider (ISP) about your intention to end the service which you had initially availed. The procedure might vary from one provider to another and is often defined by the terms and conditions of your contract.

### Who needs it?
This information is crucial for anyone who currently has an active mobile internet service but wishes to put an end to it due to reasons such as: dissatisfaction with the service, moving to a location where the service isnâ€™t offered, finding a more economical option, etc.

## Procedure
1. First, review your service contract or agreement. This will provide important information about termination penalties, notice periods, and other stipulations that could impact your cancellation.
2. Contact the customer service department of your mobile internet provider. This can typically be done by phone, online chat, or through email.
3. Inform the representative that you wish to cancel your service. Be clear and firm about your intentions.
4. They might attempt to convince you to stay with offers or deals. If you're determined to cancel, politely but firmly decline.
5. Ask for a confirmation of your cancellation. This could be a number, an email, or a physical letter. Keep it somewhere safe as proof.
6. Lastly, be sure to return any equipment (modems, routers etc.) that may belong to the provider, otherwise, you may be charged for these.

## Required Documents
The requirements may vary according to your ISP, but generally, the following documents might be required:
- Identification (e.g., passport, ID card)
- Address proof
- Service contract

## Additional details
Before you proceed with your cancellation, it's best to check for any early termination fees in your contract. If you're within a penalty window, it may be cost-effective to wait until the term is over. Also, be prepared for retention efforts from the ISP, they may try to offer you better deals to keep you in their service. Finally, remember to confirm if there are any devices that need to be returned to avoid additional charges.
