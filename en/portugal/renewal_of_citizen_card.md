## Description
### What is it?
The Citizen Card is an identification document for Portuguese citizens. It contains personal details and can be used for several purposes such as travel, access to public and private services, and digital authentication.

### Who needs it?
Any Portuguese citizen with an expiring or expired citizen card must go through the renewal process. 

## Procedure
1. The application for the renewal can be submitted online, through the [Citizen's Portal](https://eportugal.gov.pt/en-GB/inicio). 
2. If you prefer to make the request in person, you need to make an appointment. You can do this via the [website](https://www.sef.pt/pt/Pages/pre-marcacao-online.aspx), or by phone call.
3. Expedited service is available for an additional fee, for those who need their card urgently.
4. After the application is submitted and processed, the card can be picked up at an agreed-upon date.

## Required Documents
- Old Citizen Card or passport for identification.
- In case of loss, theft, or destruction you must report to the PSP - Public Security Police.
