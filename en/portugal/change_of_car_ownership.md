## Description
### What is it?
Change of Car Ownership is the process by which the legal ownership of a vehicle is transferred from one individual or entity to another.

### Who needs it?
This service is needed by anyone who has sold their car to another individual, or anyone who has bought a used car from another individual. It is critical to ensure that the vehicle is legally transferred to avoid any future liabilities.

## Procedure
1. Gather all necessary documents such as identification of both parties and the vehicle's documents. 
2. Both seller and buyer go to a Notary or Lawyer to make the 'Auto de Compra e Venda', a document that proves the car was sold.
3. After getting the 'Auto de Compra e Venda', the buyer must register the car in their name via the IMT's website [IMT Online](https://servicos.imt-ip.pt/) or in one of IMT's shops. 
4. The change in ownership is not complete until the vehicle's new registration document reflecting the new owner's details is obtained.

## Required Documents
- Identification of both parties (Passport, ID, or Driving Licence).
- Vehicle's documents such as Title, Certificate of Registration, and/or MOT Certificate.
- 'Auto de Compra e Venda' from Notary or Lawyer.
- If the car is imported, a certificate of conformity is needed.

## Additional details
- There may be penalties if you do not complete the change of ownership procedure swiftly after the sale of the vehicle.
- For imported cars, a homologation process is needed to validate if the car meets Portuguese standards.
- Additionally, keep in mind that if you've been living in Portugal for more than 180 days, it is important to decide whether you want to import the car permanently or temporarily. 
- Insurance needs to be transferred or newly set up under the new owner's name.
