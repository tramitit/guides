## Description
### What is it?
A birth certificate is an official document provided by the government, certifying an individual's birth details. It includes information such as the individual's full name, date and place of birth, and parents' names.

### Who needs it?
This document is required for various legal procedures, identity verification, school enrollment, passport application, among others.  

## Procedure
1. Contact the local Civil Registry Office (Conservatória do Registo Civil) where the birth was registered. 
2. Provide the necessary details- full name, and the date and place of birth. 
3. Pay the necessary fees for the request. 
4. Once processed, the birth certificate can either be picked up from the Civil Registry Office or mailed to the designated address.

If you are based abroad and wish to request a birth certificate from Portugal, you may need to contact the local Portuguese consulate or embassy.

## Required Documents

This process can be requested at the Civil Registry Office or through the Portuguese Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros (Ministry of Foreign Affairs).
