## Description
### What is it?
A Registration Certificate for EU Citizens is a document acknowledging an EU citizen's right to live in Portugal. This certificate is required for EU citizens staying in Portugal for longer than three months.

### Who needs it?
Any EU citizen who plans to live in Portugal for more than three months should request a Registration Certificate.

## Procedure
1. Upon arrival in Portugal and after settling down, you would need to proceed to your local City Hall (CÃ¢mara Municipal) or Parish Council (Junta de Freguesia) to request the certificate.
2. Fill out the application form for the Registration Certificate. You might need a translator if you're not proficient in Portuguese.
3. Present all required documents. Ensure they are original and valid.
4. Pay the necessary fees. The cost is usually about 15 euros but can vary slightly from region to region.

## Required Documents
1. Passport or Identity Card
2. Proof of Residence in Portugal (like a lease agreement or utility bill)

## Providers that can do it for you
Unfortunately, this process cannot be done by a third-party provider. It is mandatory for the applicant to be present in person to request their Registration Certificate.

## Additional details
Remember that the process can vary slightly depending on the city or parish. It's recommended to contact your specific local office in advance to confirm their requirements. Once you've obtained your Registration Certificate, it's important to carry it with you at all times while in Portugal.
