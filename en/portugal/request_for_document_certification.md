## Description
### What is it?
Document certification is a process where an authorized person or body confirms the authenticity of a document. This is usually necessary for documents that have to be recognized legally in foreign countries or when asked by various institutions.

### Who needs it?
Individuals who are in the process of immigration, studying abroad, tax issues, and international business transactions typically need certified documents.

## Procedure
1. Identify the document that needs certification.
2. Depending on the type of certification required, the document may need translation and notarization.
3. Present the document to a notary or the correct legal authority.
4. Pay the necessary fees, if applicable.
5. Collect the certified document once done.

## Required Documents
The documents needed would depend on the nature of the request. However, some common documents include:

- Original copy of the document
- Valid ID of the requesting party
- Notarized translation of the document (if not in Portuguese)
- Application form (specific to the certifying agency)

## Additional details
- For documents like Birth Certificates to be used abroad, you might be requested to have an Apostille, which authenticates the document for use internationally.
