## Description
### What is it?
The Request for Income Tax Declaration is a process where an individual submits their statement of earnings to tax authorities. This is usually an annual process, used by the tax authorities to assess the amount of tax one has to pay based on their income for the previous fiscal year.

### Who needs it?
This process is necessary for all individuals who have earned an income within the fiscal year. Traditionally, it is needed by salaried or self-employed individuals as well as business owners who have generated some income during the tax year.

## Procedure
1. Gather all necessary documents such as payslips and other pertinent financial documentation for the fiscal year. 
2. Complete the necessary form with your tax details. In Portugal, it'll be the IRS form available on the [**Portal das Finanças**](https://www.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt/). 
3. Submit the completed form either digitally through the tax portal or manually at your local tax office. 
4. Await notification from the tax authorities about the status of your declaration. 

## Required Documents
