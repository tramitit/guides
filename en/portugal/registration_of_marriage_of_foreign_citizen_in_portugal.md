## Description
### What is it?
The process of registering a marriage in Portugal involving a foreign citizen, with an emphasis on understanding the legalities, required documents, and procedures.
### Who needs it?
Any foreign national who intends to get married to a Portuguese citizen, or any Portuguese citizen intending to marry a foreign national.

## Procedure

1. Obtain a Certificate of No Impediment or "Ato de solteiro/a" from your country of origin. This document essentially confirms that there is no objection or legal hurdle to your marriage in your home country.

2. Get the Certificate of No Impediment legalized by local authorities. 

3. Depending on the country of origin, the document may also have to be translated to Portuguese by a certified translator.

4. The foreign partner must apply for a "Certificado do registo criminal" (Criminal Record Certificate) from their country of origin, translated and legalized as well.

5. Provide a copy of your passport and birth certificate. If these documents aren't in Portuguese, translation by a certified translator might be needed.

6. Then, take these documents to the nearest "Conservat√≥ria do Registo Civil" (Civil Registry Office) in Portugal.

7. The office will then provide you with a document certifying your intent to marry, which should be published or displayed in the registrar's office for a certain period (generally 30 days).

8. After the publication of the banns, you can go ahead with the marriage ceremony.

9. Post the ceremony, you need to register the marriage at the Civil Registry Office within three days.

## Required Documents

1. Passport and birth certificate of both partners.
2. Certificate of No Impediment
3. Criminal Record Certificate
4. Translation of documents (if required, to Portuguese)
