## Description
### What is it?
IRS Anexo I is a supplemental form that must be submitted along with the main IRS declaration in Portugal. This annex is specifically used for declaring certain types of income or financial details that are not covered within the primary IRS declaration forms.

### Who needs it?
This form is ideal for individuals required to declare specific types of income, such as foreign income or assets, detailed in various categories not included in the main declaration forms.

## Procedure
1. **Gather Necessary Information**: Collect all relevant financial information, including income from foreign sources or other special income types that need to be declared separately.
   
2. **Log into the Portal das Finanças**: Access the official Finanças portal using your credentials. If you do not have an account, you will need to register on the portal.
   
3. **Initiate IRS Declaration**: Start the IRS declaration process by selecting the year for which you are declaring taxes.
   
4. **Select Anexo I**: When prompted to choose which annexes to include, select Anexo I from the list. This will allow you to input the required special income details.
   
5. **Complete Anexo I Form**: Fill in the necessary fields in the Anexo I form carefully. Make sure to include accurate information on foreign income and other specifics as required.
   
6. **Review and Validate**: Double-check all entered information to ensure its accuracy. Use the portal's tools to validate the annex and the main IRS form.
   
7. **Submit the Declaration**: Once validated, submit the IRS declaration, including Anexo I, through the portal. Save a copy of the submission confirmation for your records.

## Required Documents
- **Identification Documents**: Such as your NIF (tax identification number) and personal identification like a citizen's card or passport.
- **Financial Statements**: Documents proving income from various sources, especially if they are foreign.
- **Bank Statements**: Especially if they pertain to different types of income that need declaration.

Ensure that all documents are obtained from trusted sources and are up to date.
