## Description
### What is it?
Passport renewal is the process of updating/expiring your current passport by obtaining a new one. 

### Who needs it?
This service is necessary for Portuguese citizens living abroad whose passports have expired or are due for renewal.

## Procedure

1. To start the process, make an appointment at the relevant foreign consulate depending on your location. You can visit the Portuguese embassy/consulate's website to schedule an appointment.

2. Attend the appointment with all the required documents. In some cases, photograph, fingerprints and signature will be taken at the consulate. 

3. Pay the passport renewal fee. In most cases, this can be done at the consulate during your appointment.

4. Once processed, the new passport can be collected from the consulate or delivered by courier. 

## Required Documents

1. Expired or expiring passport: you must present this document during your appointment. 

2. Two recent color photographs (3.5 x 4.5 cm): these photos should be taken against a plain, light-colored, and uniform background.
