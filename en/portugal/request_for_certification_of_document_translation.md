## Description
### What is it?
The Certification of Document Translation is an act where certain authorities such as notaries, certified translators, or entities specialized in translation services verify the accuracy and similarity between the translated document and the original.

### Who needs it?
Individuals who need official translations for their documents. These might include academicians who want to study abroad, immigrants who need to translate their certificates for various application processes, businesses dealing with international clients or market, or anyone in need of an officially recognized translation of their documents.

## Procedure
1. Find a professional translator who is certified or authorized by translation institutions or local government. Note that not every translator can make a certified translation.
2. Send or deliver your original documents to the translator.
3. The translator will replicate the document in the target language adhering to the layout and details of the original document.
4. The translator will then place a statement of accuracy on the translation, certifying its accuracy and completeness based on the original document.
5. The certification statement should include the translator's signature and date of certification.
6. The certified translation is then sealed to maintain confidentiality and to prevent document tampering.

## Additional details
- Certain documents may require an additional level of certification known as an Apostille, which certifies the authenticity of the signature on the translation.
- In some cases, you might need to get your translated documents notarized. Notaries public can't certify the accuracy of the translation but they can recognize the identity of the person who is signing the certification statement.
- The translation of some legal documents may require the certified translation to be approved by the consulate or embassy of the country where it will be used. Make sure you know these requirements before making your certified translation request.
