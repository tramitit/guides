## Procedure
1. Go to the [Portuguese Justice Portal](https://justica.gov.pt/Como-pedir-um-registo-criminal).
2. Select "Citizens" if you are requesting your own record or "Entities" if you are an organization requesting the certificate.
3. Fill in the required information and verify it.
4. Pay the applicable fee through the available online payment methods.
5. After successful payment, you will receive the certificate via the email provided during the registration.
   
## Required Documents
- Personal Identification Document (Passport or ID card)
- Tax Identification number

All these documents should be handy during the process as detailed information will be required.

## Additional details
If you are outside Portugal, you can still request this through the Portuguese Consulate in your country or via the Portuguese Justice Portal, as the certificate is provided electronically. If you are applying for a job as a driver or a recruitment company is asking for it, it is likely they need to ensure you have no criminal history that may affect your role.
