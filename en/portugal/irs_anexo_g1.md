### What is it?

IRS Anexo G1 is a specific annex required in the Portuguese tax return (IRS) to declare capital gains obtained from the disposal of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or other securities held for more than 365 days. Recently, it also encompasses gains from cryptocurrencies, when applicable.

### Who needs it?

This annex is necessary for taxpayers who:

- Have realized capital gains from the sale of securities held for over a year.
