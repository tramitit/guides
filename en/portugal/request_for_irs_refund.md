## Description
### What is it?
An IRS refund is a reimbursement from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for overpaid taxes or if you're eligible for certain tax credits. Taxpayers generally receive their refunds after filing their tax returns.

### Who needs it?
Anyone who overpays their taxes or qualifies for certain tax credits is eligible for an IRS refund, as determined upon filing annual tax returns.

## Procedure
1. Gather all necessary tax documents, such as W-2s, 1099s and any relevant financial information.
2. File your tax return. This can be done either electronically via [IRS's Free File system](https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free), through a tax professional, or by mail. 
3. If a refund is due, it should be reflected on your completed tax return.
4. After filing, you can track the status of your refund using [IRS's "Whereâ€™s My Refund?" tool](https://www.irs.gov/refunds).
5. The IRS issues most refunds within 21 days of the filing date if the tax return was filed electronically, or within 6 weeks for paper returns.

## Required Documents
1. Social Security Number or Taxpayer Identification Number
2. W-2 form from your employer or 1099 form if self-employed
3. Additional income statements if applicable
4. Record of deductible expenses if you itemize deductions
