## Description
### What is it?
Registering a business in Portugal involves the process of legalizing one's company so it can freely operate within the country. This journey includes deciding on a company's name, accomplishing legal and finance-related paperwork, and dealing with local and national government requirements.
### Who needs it?
This guide is perfect for both local and foreign individuals or entities who wish to start a business in Portugal.

## Procedure
1. Decide on a company name and check its availability in the National Register of Legal Persons (RNPC). 
2. Prepare the Articles of Association, which will outline key information about your business including what it does and how it will operate.
3. Submit your registration request to the "On the Spot Firm" (Empresa na Hora) program, which will simplify the business registration process. More information can be found [here](https://justica.gov.pt/Servicos/Empresa-na-Hora).
4. Apply for a corporate taxpayer card at any local tax office, or the Finan√ßas.
5. Register your company in the Portuguese Social Security.

## Required Documents
1. Proof of residency for foreign nationals. EU nationals will need an EU Citizen Card while non-EU nationals will need a Portuguese residence permit.
2. National Identification Card for Portuguese nationals.
3. Articles of Association.
4. Proof of initial capital.
5. Proof of a valid Portuguese address.
