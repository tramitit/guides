## Description
### What is it?
Renewal of driving license refers to the process of extending the validity of your current driving license. This is extremely important for those residing abroad since expired licenses may not be universally accepted and could create legal issues when driving in a foreign country. 

### Who needs it?
This service is needed by any individual who is living abroad, especially in Portugal, the UK, or Brazil, and whose driving license is nearing expiration.

## Procedure
1. Check your license's expiration date.
2. If you're in UK, follow the process specified by the DVLA ([Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency](https://www.gov.uk/renew-driving-licence)).
3. For those residing in Portugal, please visit [IMT - Portuguese Institute for Mobility and Transport](https://www.imt-ip.pt/sites/IMTT/Portugues/Paginas/IMTHome.aspx) to start the process of renewal.
4. If you're in Brazil, visit the DETRAN ([Department of Traffic](http://www.detran.sp.gov.br/)) of your state and proceed according to the guidelines provided. 
5. Always keep in mind the local regulations and requirements surrounding renewal procedures, they might vary from country to country.

## Required Documents
