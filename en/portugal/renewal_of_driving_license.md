3. For those residing in Portugal, please visit [IMT - Portuguese Institute for Mobility and Transport](https://www.imt-ip.pt/) to start the process of renewal.
4. If you're in Brazil, visit the DETRAN ([Department of Traffic](http://www.detran.sp.gov.br/)) of your state and proceed according to the guidelines provided. 
5. Always keep in mind the local regulations and requirements surrounding renewal procedures, they might vary from country to country.
