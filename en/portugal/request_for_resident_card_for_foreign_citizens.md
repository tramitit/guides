## Description
### What is it?
An application for a resident card for foreign citizens in Portugal. This is typically required for non-Portuguese individuals who intend to stay in the country for longer durations, often exceeding six months.

Mainly required by non-EU citizens, including students, workers, self-employed individuals, interns, volunteers, or family members, who are planning to live in Portugal for a long term.

2. Attend your appointment in person to submit your application. Non-EU citizens are required to provide their passport, two recent passport-sized photos, valid travel insurance, evidence of sufficient means of subsistence, and accommodation proof.

3. If you are intending to work in Portugal, you may also need to provide a work contract.

4. Pay the associated fee and wait for the processing to complete. The waiting period can differ significantly based on individual cases.

## Additional details
The validation of a resident card may take several weeks or, in some cases, several months. Furthermore, the documentation needed for the application can vary significantly depending on individual circumstances, so it is recommended to check with SEF for any specific requirements. Also, note that some of the documents need to be translated into Portuguese by a professional translator recognized by the consulate.
