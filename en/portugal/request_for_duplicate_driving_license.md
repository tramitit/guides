## Description
### What is it?
A duplicate driving license is a copy of your original driving license, which is needed in the event of loss, theft, or damage to the original license.
### Who needs it?
Any licensed driver who has lost, had stolen, or damaged their original driving license and needs a replacement.

## Procedure
1. Report the loss, theft, or damage of your driving license to the police.
 
2. Visit the nearest 'Instituto da Mobilidade e dos Transportes' (IMT) office. You can find the locations [here](http://www.imt-ip.pt/sites/IMTT/Portugues/Paginas/home.aspx).
