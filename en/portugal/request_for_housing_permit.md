## Description
### What is it?
A Housing Permit, also known as a 'Licença de Habitação' in Portugal, is a legal document that certifies a specific property’s suitability for human habitation.
### Who needs it?
The permit is needed by anyone who intends to buy, sell, or rent property in Portugal.

## Procedure
1. Begin with a preliminary consultation at the Municipal Town Planning Department (Departamento Municipal de Planeamento Urbano) of your city council (Câmara Municipal). 
2. Submit a draft of your project, along with the property’s floor plan design, layout, and building specifications. 
3. After obtaining approval for the draft, compile all necessary documents and submit them along with your completed application form.
4. Once verified, the construction proposal will be accepted. At this point, you’ll receive your Building Permit (Licença de Construção), allowing you to start construction.
5. After the construction is complete, communicate completion to the local authority. 
6. The final step is an inspection arranged by the city council. Upon successful inspection, a Use Permit (Licença de Utilização) or Housing Permit will be issued.

## Required Documents
- Identification documents (ID/ passport)
- Property's Land Registry Certificate (Certidão de Teor)
- Caderneta Predial
- Detailed draft of the property project
- Property's floor plan design, layout, and building specification
- Discharge to Public Sewage System Certificate
- Acoustic Certification
