## Description
### What is it?
The SNS User Card (Cartão de Utente do SNS) is a card issued by the Portuguese National Health Service, providing access to healthcare services within Portugal.

### Who needs it?
This card is necessary for any resident in Portugal, regardless of nationality, who wishes to use the services provided by the Portuguese Health System (SNS).

## Procedure
1. First, you need to get a NIF (Número de Identificação Fiscal). This is a tax identification number which is required to get the SNS User Card.
2. Register at the local health center. You will need the passport, proof of residency and NIF.
3. After registration, request for the User Card.
4. The User Card will be mailed to your registered address once it's ready.

## Required Documents
- Passport
- Proof of residence : e.g., a rental agreement, utility bill etc.
- NIF : The tax identification number which can be obtained from the local tax office.
