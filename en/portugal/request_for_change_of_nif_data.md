## Description
### What is it?
The NIF (Número de Identificação Fiscal), essentially serves as your tax identification number. Sometimes, due to various circumstances like changing the place of residence or company name, etc., you may need to request a change in your NIF Data.

### Who needs it?
Anyone (individuals or organizations) registered in Portugal needing to amend or update their tax information including the resident address, company name, marital status etc., requires this change in NIF Data.

## Procedure
Below is the general procedure for requesting a change of NIF Data:
1. Visit the website of the [Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira (Tax and Customs Authority)](https://www.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt/).
2. Log in using your personal NIF number and password.
3. Go to the tab "Os Seus Serviços" (Your Services).
4. Click on "Alterar a Situação Fiscal" (Alter Tax Situation).
5. Fill out the necessary forms with the correct updated information.
6. Submit your application. After your application has been processed, you will receive a confirmation e-mail about the changes.

## Required Documents
The documents required can vary depending on the information to be changed:
- Proof of new residence (like a utility bill or rental agreement) if you are changing your address.
- Marriage Certificate in case of change in marital status.
- Other relevant documentation based on the type of change required.
