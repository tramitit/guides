## Description

### What is it?

Social housing, or logement social in France, is a form of housing intended for individuals and families with lower incomes. These are provided by housing associations and include apartments, houses, and rooms among others.

### Who needs it?

The service is designed for those who are financially strained and cannot afford the market rate for housing. It's especially beneficial for the unemployed, intermittent workers, young professionals, and large families among others.

## Procedure

2. Gather Necessary Documents: Gather the required documents needed for the application.
3. Fill out the Application Form: Fill the form "Demande de logement social" which can be found online.
4. Submit the Application: Submit the completed form along with the necessary documents. This can be done online, or at a local government office.
5. Await Approval: After submission, your application will be examined and if approved, you will be assigned housing based on availability and your defined preference.

## Additional details

Please note that applying for social housing does not guarantee housing assignment. Because the demand for social housing usually exceeds the supply, there may be significant waiting times. The assignment of housing is based on a points system that prioritizes need. Importantly, intermittent workers or people with unstable jobs can also apply and some dedicated providers are available to help these demographics access social housing. 
Also remember to renew your application each year as your application is only valid for a year.
