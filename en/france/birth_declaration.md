## Description
### What is it?
A birth declaration in France is a formal procedure that involves acknowledging the birth of a child to the civil authorities in France. 

### Who needs it?
This procedure is essential for any parent who has given birth in France. 

## Procedure
1. The birth must be declared in the town where the child was born within 5 days after the day of birth. 
2. You need to go to the Civil Registry Office (Office de l'Ã©tat civil) of the city hall (Mairie) to make the declaration.
3. Your identification and evidence of the birth (as provided by the doctor or midwife) will be necessary.

## Required Documents
You will need the following documents for the birth declaration:
- Proof of identity of both parents.
- Certificate of delivery provided by the doctor or midwife who witnessed the birth.
- Acknowledgement if done before the birth.
- Your family record book (Livre de famille), if you have one.
- If applicable, a copy of the marital contract or notarial deed of declaration of joint custody or single declaration of choice or country of the common-law attachment.
