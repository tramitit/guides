## Description
### What is it?
The Personalized Autonomy Allowance (APA) is a French assistance allowance for elderly individuals who have lost independence due to physical or mental health conditions. This allowance helps cover costs related to assistance and care.

### Who needs it?
The allowance is ideal for individuals who are above 60 years old and need help with daily living activities due to a loss of autonomy.

## Procedure
1. Visit the official French government portal for Family Allowance or your local social action department (Centre Communal d'Action Sociale).
2. Fill out the application form for APA, providing all the necessary details.
3. Submit the completed form along with necessary supporting documents.
4. Following a successful application submission, an evaluator will visit the applicant's home to determine the level of dependence.
5. Based on the evaluation, APA will be assigned and granted.

## Required Documents
* Identification proof
* Proof of residence
* Medical certificate detailing the level of dependence
* Most recent tax statement
