## Description
### What is it?
The Personalized Autonomy Allowance (APA) is a French assistance allowance for elderly individuals who have lost independence due to physical or mental health conditions. This allowance helps cover costs related to assistance and care.

### Who needs it?
The allowance is ideal for individuals who are above 60 years old and need help with daily living activities due to a loss of autonomy.

2. Fill out the application form for APA, providing all the necessary details.
3. Submit the completed form along with necessary supporting documents.
4. Following a successful application submission, an evaluator will visit the applicant's home to determine the level of dependence.
5. Based on the evaluation, APA will be assigned and granted.
