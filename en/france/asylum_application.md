## Description
### What is it?
An asylum application refers to the procedure to seek protection from a foreign country due to fear of persecution or harm in one's home country. Countries across the world, including France, grant protection to asylum seekers under international law.

### Who needs it?
Any individual fearing persecution or harm in their home country due to factors such as race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social or political group can apply for asylum. This includes individuals who identify as transgender and are facing threats or violence in their home country.

## Procedure
1. Express your intent to apply for asylum at a border point or in the territory of France.
2. You will be given a document named `Asylum application certificate` which will confirm your status as an asylum seeker and permit you to stay in France while your application is assessed.
3. An interview will be conducted by the `French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (OFPRA)` to evaluate your situation and motivations.
4. If your application is rejected by OFPRA, you may appeal this decision to the National Court of Asylum Law (CNDA).

## Required Documents
1. Proof of identity (passport, ID card)
2. Any documents supporting your reasons for seeking asylum (documents proving persecution or threats faced, pertaining to your fear or personal situation).

## Additional details
Seek legal advice from organisations providing support to asylum seekers in France. The CNDA and OFPRA provide legal advice free of charge. Be patient, as it may take some time for the French authorities to make a decision about your application. Stay connected with the authorities and inform them about any changes to your situation.
