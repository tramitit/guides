## Description

### What is it?
Alimony, also known as spousal support, is a court-ordered provision of financial support to a spouse after separation or divorce. In France, this is referred to as "pension alimentaire". 

### Who needs it?
Anyone who is going through a separation or divorce and requires financial support from the ex-spouse may seek alimony. Particularly, this comes into use when the person doesn't have sufficient means to maintain an acceptable lifestyle post-separation.

## Procedure

1. Gather your financial information
2. Consult with a Family Law attorney to understand your legal rights and obligations.
3. Submit your alimony request to the judge during the divorce process. The judge will take into account several factors such as your income, your ex-spouse's income, your standard of living during the marriage, your age and health, and the length of the marriage.
4. If the judge grants your request, the alimony amount will be set and must be paid by your ex-spouse.

## Required Documents

- Proof of income (such as pay slips, income tax returns) for both spouses
- Proof of assets (bank statements, real estate documents, etc.)
- Proof of expenses (rent or mortgage payments, utility bills, food and clothing expenses, etc.)

## Additional Details
It's important to know that the judge can adjust the alimony amount if there are significant changes in the financial situation of either party. Also, keep in mind that non-payment of alimony amounts can be prosecuted as a crime in France. Consider reaching out to legal professionals or institutions to understand the detailed course of action in such cases.
