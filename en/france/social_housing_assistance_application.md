## Description
### What is it?
Social housing assistance is a service provided by the government to offer affordable accommodation to individuals and families unable to afford housing at market rates. It can either be permanent or temporary housing.

### Who needs it?
Ideally, this service is available to persons with low income, single parents, aged persons, disabled persons, and anyone who is unable to afford market-rate houses.

## Procedure
1. Understand your eligibility: Not everyone qualifies for social housing. To find out if you do, check out [this link](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000000509779/). 
2. Application: Applications for social housing in France should be done online through the [governmentâ€™s website](https://www.demande-logement-social.gouv.fr/) where you will fill an application form (SLS) and receive a social housing registration number after submission.
3. Follow up: Keep track of your application and ensure you have notifications enabled since any updates are usually communicated online.
4. Wait for a response: The waiting period varies depending on the availability and demand for social housing in your region.

## Required Documents
- Proof of income in the last two years
- Identification Documents
- Rental statement from your landlord or if living in a hotel, a certificate from the hotel
- For foreigners, a valid resident permit is required. 

These documents can be uploaded during the application process online.

## Additional details
In France, three types of social housing are available; Very Social Housings (THS), Social Housings (LS) and Intermediate Housings (LI). Each housing type has different income thresholds with THS having the lowest and LI the highest.

Though the application is free, obtaining an actual social housing unit could take time. The waiting period greatly varies according to the area. People in Paris usually wait for longer compared to those in other regions. 

Remember always to keep your information up-to-date and report any change in circumstances to the relevant authorities.
