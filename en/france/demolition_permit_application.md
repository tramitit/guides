## Description
### What is it?
A demolition permit is a legal document that grants permission to tear down an existing structure. It ensures that the demolition process respects local regulations and standards, including safety measures, waste disposal, and impact on neighboring properties.

### Who Needs It?
Anyone planning to demolish an existing residential or commercial building in France needs a demolition permit. This includes homeowners, property developers, construction companies, and contractors.

## Procedure
1. Evaluate whether your project needs a demolition permit. Some minor demolitions might not need a permit, depending on local laws.
2. Determine which agency in your area is responsible for issuing demolition permits. It's typically the local planning or building department.
3. Visit the official website of your municipality or county to find an application form or online application process.
   Example: Paris - [Direction de l'Urbanisme](https://api-site.paris.fr/images/80149)
4. Fill out the application form with detailed information about the property and the planned demolition. This might include the reason for the demolition, the structureâ€™s size and age, and methods of waste disposal.
5. Submit the form along with any required documents. These generally include proof of ownership, a site plan of the property, and a method statement.
6. Pay the applicable fee for the demolition permit.
7. Wait for the authorities to review your application. They may conduct an onsite inspection before approving the permit.

## Required Documents
* Proof of Ownership - This can either be a property deed or property tax document.
* Site Plan - A detailed diagram of the property showing all existing structures.
* Method Statement - A document outlining how the demolition will be carried out, including safety measures and a waste management plan.
