## Description
### What is it?
Naturalization is the legal process through which a non-citizen of a country may acquire citizenship or nationality of that country. In the context of this guide, we will be focusing on the Naturalization process in France.

### Who needs it?
This might be required by foreigners who have been living in France for some time and comply with specific criteria that make them eligible for naturalization.

## Procedure
1. The first step in the French naturalization process is to determine if you are eligible. The general rules are that you need to have been living and working in France for five years, though this can be reduced in certain circumstances.

2. Download and fill out the naturalization application form (*dossier de naturalisation*). The form can be downloaded from [here](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F2213).

3. Collect the necessary documents to support your application. Check below for the list of required documents.

4. Submit your application at your local prefecture or sub-prefecture. 

## Required Documents
- Proof of Identity
- Proof of address
- Residency permit, showing that you have lived in France for at least five years
- Proof of fiscal domicile for the last three years
- Document stating you have a sufficient knowledge of the French language
- Birth certificate translated into French
  
Do note that some documents might need to be legalized or apostilled. Also, some documents may not be older than three months (like the proof of address).
