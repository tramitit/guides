## Description
### What is it?
Mobility aids include devices designed to assist walking or otherwise improve the mobility of people with a mobility impairment. In France, these can range from simple devices such as white canes to complex machinery such as wheelchairs or mobility scooters.

### Who needs it?
Anyone with a mobility impairment that restricts their ability to move, whether due to permanent disability, injury, or age.

## Procedure
1. Determine your need for a mobility aid. Consult with your doctor or therapist for their recommendation.
2. Apply for recognition of the disability through the [Maison Départementale des Personnes Handicapées (MDPH)](http://www.mdph.fr/).
3. Fill out the [Cerfa form n°15692*01](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/R19993), which details your situation and the requested aid.
4. Submit the form to your local MDPH office along with the required medical certificates.

## Required Documents
- Medical diagnosis detailing your mobility impairment.
- Proof of identity, such as a passport or ID card.
- Proof of residence, such as a utility bill or rental contract.

## Additional details
- Not all mobility aids will be fully covered by social security, and you may incur costs.
- If you are traveling and need temporary access to a mobility aid, there are places such as Disneyland Paris or major tourism sites that offer rental services.
- In case of mobility aid requirements due to temporary injury or hospital stay, speak with the relevant hospital staff about access to mobility aids during your recovery.
