## Description

### What is it?
A French residence permit, or “titre de séjour,” is an official document that allows non-French citizens to live in France for a specific period. This guide explains how to renew this permit.

### Who needs it?
Non-French citizens living in France with a residence permit (“titre de séjour”) that is nearing its expiration date. 

## Procedure

1. Start the renewal process several months before your current permit expires. 

2. Make sure your current residence and contact details are updated with your local prefecture. 

3. Monitor the local prefecture's online portal or visit in person for updates on the renewal process or to set a renewal appointment.

4. Prepare required documents for submission.

5. Attend your appointment and submit your application.

6. If successful, you'll receive a “récépissé de demande de carte de séjour,” a temporary document that allows you to remain in the country while your renewal is being processed.

## Required Documents

- Passport or other travel documents.
- Current “titre de séjour”.
- Recent passport-size photos.
- Proof of residence (“Justificatif de domicile”), e.g., a rent receipt or utility bill.
- Evidence of financial support, such as salary slips or bank statements.
- Other documents may be required depending on your situation (student, working, etc.)

## Providers that can do it for you

| Provider        |     Website     |     Timelines    |       Cost      |
| --------------- | --------------- |  :-------------: | :-------------: |
| Prefecture      | [Prefecture Website](http://www.préfecture.fr/) |   Varies according to each Prefecture   |   Official fees vary depending on type of permit   |

## Additional details
It’s advisable to keep every piece of official paper that you receive from the French administration, as you never know when it might be required. Also, consider using a mail service with delivery confirmation when sending documents to the 'Préfecture'. This can provide proof of the submission of your documents. Always ask for receipts for any transaction with the administration.

The timelines for the residence permit renewal process can vary and may take several months. It's advisable to start the process as early as possible. 

Remember that while you’re waiting for your new “titre de séjour,” your “récépissé de demande de carte de séjour” allows you to stay legally in France. It is not a travel document, i.e., it does not guarantee your re-entry into France if you leave the country.

In case of difficulties securing an appointment for your renewal, keep trying. Slots are often released over time. It may also be possible to renew through a drop-box system or by mail, depending on the Prefecture. 

Please note that this information may vary depending on your specific situation or changes in the 'Préfecture’s' renewal process. We recommend checking the Préfecture's website or contacting them directly for the most accurate information.
