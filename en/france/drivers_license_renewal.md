### What is it?
Renewal of a driver's license is the process of renewing your existing driving license after its expiry date. This procedure helps to keep your driving license up to date and ensures you're legally allowed to drive, avoiding any penalties.

### Who needs it?
This service is needed by anyone with an expired driver's license or a license nearing its expiry date. It is also necessary for non-French citizens residing in France and wishing to continue driving.

## Procedure
1. Visit the Official website of the French Public Service [ANTS](https://ants.gouv.fr/)
2. Log in to your account or create one if you do not have it.
3. Navigate to the driver's license section.
4. Follow the instructions provided to submit an application for driver's license renewal.
5. You will be required to upload some documents (please see the Required Documents section).
6. Pay the renewal fee online using a credit/debit card.
7. Submit the application.
8. On approval, you will receive a temporary license before receiving the permanent one.

## Required Documents
- Your current driver's license.
- Proof of residence (varies for foreign residents in France).
