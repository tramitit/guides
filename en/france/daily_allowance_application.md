## Description
### What is it?
Daily allowance or indemnité journalière is a partial salary paid to an employee who is unable to work due to sickness or accident. This is a part of the Social Security system in France.

### Who needs it?
It is ideal for every employee who is unable to work due to health issues and want to apply for a sick leave. It helps in maintaining a certain financial stability during this period.

## Procedure
1. When you are declared unfit for work by your doctor, ask for a work stoppage certificate (arrêt de travail).
2. Send the documentary evidence (feuille d'arrêt maladie) within 48 hours to the health insurance fund (CPAM).
3. Send the third volet of the work stoppage certificate to your employer. Also inform about your sickness to your employer.
4. CPAM will then process your information and look for eligibility.
5. Once approved, you can start receiving your daily allowances.

## Required Documents
- Work stoppage certificate (arrêt de travail) issued by your doctor.
- Any other document as may be requested by CPAM.
- Proof of income may also be required.
