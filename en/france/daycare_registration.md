## Description
### What is it?
Daycare registration is the process by which parents sign their children up to attend a daycare centre or programme. In this context, we will detail the process as it applies to Canada, particularly Québec and Ontario.

### Who needs it?
This process is generally needed by working parents who require reliable, quality care for their children during working hours. 

## Procedure

1. Research different daycare providers in your region, comparing them on metrics like quality of care, pricing, schedule, language of instruction (many daycares in Canada, especially in Québec, offer French immersion) and proximity to your home or work. Links to several online directories of daycare providers can be found [here](https://www.ontario.ca/page/child-care-and-daycare).
2. Once you've selected a few potential providers, visit their locations if possible to get a feel for their environments and meet with the staff. This can help you make a final selection.
3. When you have chosen your preferred provider, visit its website or contact them directly to get information on the application process. Some providers may have online applications, while others may require you to fill out paper forms.
4. Fill out the application form with all requested information about your child and your family. You will typically need to provide details such as your child's name and age, your contact information and work schedule, and any special needs or requests for your child.
5. Submit the application form, along with any required documents and fees. The daycare provider should provide you with confirmation of your application and information on the next steps in the process.

## Required Documents
You will typically need to provide some or all of the following documents during the daycare registration process:

- Proof of identity for your child (e.g., birth certificate, passport)
- Proof of residence (e.g., utility bill, rental agreement)
- Immunization records for your child
- Any necessary medical documents.

## Additional details
- Some daycares in Canada offer French language instruction or immersion. This can be beneficial if you want your child to become bilingual, but it's helpful to ensure in advance that your child will be able to navigate this environment. In Québec, grants may be available to attend a francisation program.
- The cost of daycare varies depending on location, provider and child's age, but subsidies are often available for low-income families.
