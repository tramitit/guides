## Description
### What is it?
A resident card, also known as a 'Carte de Résident', is a document that validates the legal status of a foreign individual residing in France for an extended period. This card typically grants the holder the right to live and work in France.

### Who needs it?
Any non-French citizen planning to live in France for a period longer than three months needs a resident card. This is especially relevant for those intending to work or study in the country.

## Procedure
1. Make an appointment at the local prefecture. They are the main bodies that accept and process these applications.
2. Fill out the appropriate forms. These will likely be provided to you at your appointment at the prefecture.
3. Collect the necessary documents. The documents required could vary depending on your individual situation.
4. Attend your appointment and submit your completed application.
5. Wait for processing. This could take several months.
6. If accepted, you will receive a 'récépissé'. This is a temporary permit validating your stay while waiting for the release of your actual card.

## Required Documents
- Valid passport
- Proof of address (a rent receipt, electricity/gas bill, or a residence certificate from the City Hall will do)
- Identity photographs
- Evidence of financial self-sufficiency. This may include bank statements, pay slips, or tax notices.
- Health insurance coverage
- If employed: work contract and recent pay slips
- If student: school registration
- Other documents might be required depending on the individual case

## Additional details
It's important to note that some prefectures might accept your application by mail, while others require an in-person appointment. The appointment can sometimes be done online depending on the prefecture. Renewals can also typically be done by mail.

Note that a 'récépissé’ does not enable you to travel back to France if you leave, except under specific conditions (return visa). If you’re planning to leave France for a short period while your carte de séjour is being renewed, you should apply at your prefecture for a re-entry permit (Autorisation Provisoire de Retour).

The French resident card does not automatically grant you the right to work in the rest of the EU. You would still need to comply with the specific immigration rules of other EU countries.

Having a resident status in France for at least five years allows you to request a Certificate of Residence for Long-Term Residents (Carte de résident de longue durée-UE).
