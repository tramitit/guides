## Description
### What is it?
Sick leave application is a formal process needed to inform one's employer about the period of their absence due to a health problem, which includes physical or mental illnesses. It usually requires a medical document proving the condition and specifying the estimated duration of the illness.

### Who needs it?
Any worker employed in France under a legal contract who finds themselves unable to perform their work due to a medical condition, physically or mentally, and need to take a break from work for health recovery.

## Procedure
1. Consult a healthcare provider or a psychiatrist to determine your condition.
2. If necessary, the doctor will give you a medical certificate of work incapacitation.
3. Submit the certificate to your employer to notify them about your condition and your temporary incapacity for work.
4. Depending on your location, there might be further procedures to follow under the local law regulations.

## Required Documents
- Medical certificate of work incapacitation, also known as "arrÃªt de travail" in France.

## Additional details
- Applying for a sick leave is the same in case of physical and mental illnesses. In France, workers are entitled to daily allowances if they have worked for at least 200 hours during the three months prior to stopping work.
- In Switzerland, employees who are unable to work, due to illness, by more than 25% are entitled to daily allowances from the third week following the illness. 
- Depending on the contract and the company policy, the employer might have the right to commission a second medical opinion to determine the validity of the sick leave.
