## Description
### What is it?
The Childcare Choice Supplement (CMG) is a childcare supplement that assists families with part of the costs associated with employing a registered nanny or using an accredited micro-creche.

### Who needs it?
This supplement is ideal for working or student parents who have children under the age of six and live in France. 

## Procedure
1. Research local childcare options and determine your need for a registered nanny or micro-creche.
2. Contact Pajemploi, a service offered by Urssaf to simplify the procedures for parents using home-based childminders.
    - You can visit their website [here](https://www.pajemploi.urssaf.fr/pajewebinfo/cms/sites/pajewebinfo/accueil/index.html)
3. Register your nanny or micro-creche with Pajemploi.
4. Fill in your family quotient via your personal online space at the following [link](https://www.caf.fr/allocataires/droits-et-prestations/s-informer-sur-les-aides/petite-enfance/le-complement-libre-choix-du-mode-de-garde)
5. File your request for Childcare Choice Supplement to the Family Allowance Fund (CAF).
6. Wait for your CAF benefits statement (usually arrives within 2 weeks).
7. Pay your childcare provider through Pajemploi. Your CAF benefits will be automatically deducted from your payment.
