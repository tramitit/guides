## Description
### What is it?
Complementary health insurance, also known as a "mutuelle", is a voluntary insurance coverage in France that complements the coverage provided by the Social Security system. It's meant to reimburse the portion of healthcare costs that are not completely covered by the French Social Security.

### Who needs it?
This insurance is ideal for everyone residing in France as healthcare costs can be significant even after the initial coverage by Social Security. In particular, it can be highly beneficial for individuals with recurring medical expenses or families with children.

## Procedure

1. Evaluate your needs: Take into account your age, health condition, type of medical services you usually need, and your financial means.

2. Compare insurers: Use comparison tools online to compare different insurance coverages and prices.

3. Contact providers: Once you selected an insurance provider, contact them for more details or to setup a meeting.

4. Complete the application: You will have to fill out a detailed questionnaire about your medical history.

5. Review Contract: Thoroughly review the contract, paying close attention to the duration, the terms of termination, the coverage limits among others.

6. Sign and submit: Once everything is to your satisfaction, sign the contract and submit it along with the required documents.

## Required Documents

You will typically need the following documents:

- Proof of residence
- Identification documents (ID or Passport)
- Social Security number
- Bank account details

Please note that additional documentation may be required depending upon your specific situation or the insurer's requirements.
