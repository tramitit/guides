## Description
### What is it?
Unemployment benefits are financial support provided by the French government to individuals who are currently unemployed through no fault of their own, and who are actively seeking employment.

### Who needs it?
The service is suitable for individuals who have recently become unemployed, through circumstances such as termination, company bankruptcy, or end of contract. It serves as a temporary financial aid until they are able to secure new employment.

## Procedure 

1. Register with Pôle emploi. This can be done online at [www.pole-emploi.fr](https://www.francetravail.fr/accueil/).
2. After registration, you'll receive an appointment for a meeting with a Pôle emploi advisor. 
3. During the appointment, your rights and obligations are explained, and a personalised plan is established to help you return to work. You will also be required to sign a Commitment to Act.
4. File an application for unemployment benefits either online or during your meeting with the Pôle emploi advisor.
5. Pôle emploi will assess your eligibility for unemployment benefits.
6. If you're deemed eligible, you'll receive a letter notification that includes the date when the payments will begin and its monthly amount.

## Required Documents

- Certificate of employment (attestation d’emploi) for each job held during the last 28 months.
- The receipts for any holiday pay, compensation, or redundancy payment.
- Proof of identity (passport or identity card).
- Proof of residence (recent utility bill or rent receipt).

## Additional details

- You may receive an overpayment letter if when there was a miscalculation on your unemployment benefits. It is suggested to contest it by writing a letter to Pôle emploi.
- It is best to keep a good record of all your unemployment-related documents for instances such as these.
- In case of resignation, you may not be immediately eligible for unemployment benefits. Certain legitimate reasons for resignation may permit you to receive benefits. It's best to consult Pôle emploi for advice in such cases.
