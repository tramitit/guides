## Description
### What is it?
A building permit is a formal document required by the local or national government that allows for the construction or major alteration of a building structure within its jurisdiction. The process involves a detailed review of a proposed building project to ensure it complies with all zoning and building codes.
### Who needs it?
A building permit is crucial for homeowners, contractors, or developers planning to construct a new building, carry out extensive repairs, renovations, or alter the use of an existing building. 

## Procedure

1. Identify your project: Define your construction project details. This includes the nature of the work, location, and size of the building, among others.

2. Get a design: You will need a detailed architectural design of your building project. This may require hiring a professional architect or engineer.

3. Application form: Obtain the official application form and carefully fill in the requested details.

4. Prepare documentation: Collect all necessary documents including your architectural design and property land title. 

5. Submission: Submit the application form alongside the required documents to the local authority or planning department. 

6. Review: The local authority will review your application and may request an on-site inspection.

7. Approval: Once the review is done and everything is in order, your building permit should be granted.

## Additional details
The duration of the permit application process can vary depending on the local authority and the complexity of the work. If permission is refused, you can modify your plans and resubmit or appeal the decision. Remember that working without a permit where one is required can result in penalties and extra costs.
