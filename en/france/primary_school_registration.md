## Description
### What is it?
Registration for primary school forms the first part of a child's formal education in France. It begins with "La Maternelle," which is a form of preschool, and proceeds to primary school. These early years of education are essential to a child's social and educational development.

### Who needs it?
Any guardian or parent residing in France who has a child ready to start primary school needs to go through the primary school registration process.

## Procedure
1. Determine your local school: Schools in France are generally assigned based on the location of your home. You can find your local school by contacting your local town hall (Mairie).
2. Schedule a meeting with the director of the school: It's necessary to set up a meeting to discuss your child's needs and the school's expectation. This also serves as an opportunity to tour the school.
3. Fill out the application form: After the meeting, you'll be required to complete an enrolment form, which collects basic information about your child.
4. Provide the required documents: You have to present certain documents, explained in the following section, at the moment of registration.
5. Confirm enrollment: Once the form has been reviewed and the necessary documents provided, the school will confirm your child's enrollment.

## Required Documents
- Proof of address, usually in the form of a utility bill or a rent agreement.
- Child's birth certificate.
- Child's health records, including vaccination status.
