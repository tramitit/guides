## Description
### What is it?
Changing your address refers to the process of updating your location information on various platforms or services like Revolut, Olympics, Vinted etc. The process varies depending on the platform.

### Who needs it?
This guide may be beneficial for those who have moved from one location to another and need to update their profile information on various platforms or for those looking to change their email. 

## Procedure
1. For Revolut, navigate to Profile → Personal Details → Residence. You need to keep your app up to date, in order to constantly have the newest features.
