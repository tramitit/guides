## Description
### What is it?
A residence permit, or Titre de Séjour, is a document that legally authorizes you to reside in France for a certain period of time. It is required for non-EU nationals who intend to stay in France for more than three months.

### Who needs it?
Anyone intending to live and work in France for an extended period of time, particularly those who are not EU citizens, needs a residence permit.

## Procedure

1. **Preparation**: Once you arrive in France, gather the necessary documents you will need for the application.
2. **Appointment Setup**: Make an appointment at your local préfecture (French local administration) to submit your application. You can visit their website to find out the necessary details.
3. **Application Submission**: Attend the appointment and submit your application along with the required documents. You will be issued a récépissé, a temporary document valid for 3 months, which confirms your application has been submitted and is being processed.
4. **Await Decision**: Wait for your application to be processed. This can take several months.
5. **Collecting Your Residence Permit**: Once your application is approved, you will be notified and asked to collect your residence permit from the préfecture.

## Required Documents

- Passport or national ID card
- Proof of residence in France (rental contract, or utility bill)
- Proof of sufficient resources (bank statements, job contract, salary slips)
- Proof of health insurance

Please ensure the documents are up-to-date and preferably translated into French.
