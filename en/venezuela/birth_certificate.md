## Procedure

5. If needed, visit the corresponding regional office that can provide a certified copy of the birth certificate.
6. Finally, if any authentication is needed for international use, follow the Apostille procedure as specified by Venezuelan authorities.


## Required documents

- A valid identification document (Cedula or passport) of the requester.
- Details of the registered birth: Full name, date of birth, and parents' names.
