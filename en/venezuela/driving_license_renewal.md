### What is it?
The Driving License Renewal service in Venezuela helps citizens and residents update their expired or soon-to-expire driving licenses. This ensures they remain compliant with local driving laws and avoid penalties for driving with an outdated license.

### Who needs it?
This service is ideal for Venezuelan citizens or residents whose driving licenses are about to expire or have already expired. It is also essential for individuals who are legally residing in Venezuela, including those under TPS (Temporary Protected Status), who need to drive for work, personal, or other reasons.

2. Log in or create an account using your national ID and personal details.
3. Select the option for license renewal and fill in the required application form.
4. Pay the renewal fee through the available online payment methods.
5. Schedule an appointment at your nearest INTT office for biometric verification and a vision test.
6. Attend the appointment with all necessary documents for verification.
7. Receive your renewed driving license via mail or pick it up at the designated INTT office.


## Required documents
