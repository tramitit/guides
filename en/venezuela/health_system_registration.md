This registration is essential for legal residents, expats, and newly arrived immigrants to ensure they have access to both emergency and routine medical services.

### Who needs it?
The Health System Registration service is ideal for Venezuelan citizens, residents, expatriates, and immigrants who plan to live in Venezuela.
