## Description
### What is it?
Trademark registration in Venezuela is a legal process that grants exclusive rights to use a brand name, logo, or symbol. This helps businesses protect their identity and prevent unauthorized use by others.

### Who needs it?
Entrepreneurs, companies, and individuals operating in Venezuela who want to legally secure their brand, products, or services from infringement and establish a distinctive market presence require trademark registration.

## Procedure

1. Conduct a trademark search on the SAPI database to ensure your trademark is unique.
2. Prepare the required documents, including a clear representation of the trademark and a list of goods or services associated with it.
3. Submit the application form to the Servicio Autónomo de la Propiedad Intelectual (SAPI).
4. Pay the applicable fees and keep the payment receipts for verification.
5. Wait for the formal examination conducted by SAPI.
6. Respond to any objections or requirements stipulated by the SAPI within the given timeframe.
7. Once approved, your trademark will be published in the Intellectual Property Gazette for opposition.
8. If no oppositions are filed, your trademark will be registered, and you will receive the registration certificate.
