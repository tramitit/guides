## Description
### What is it?
The process of reporting a lost or stolen ID card in Austria involves notifying the relevant authorities and requesting a replacement card. This is important to prevent potential identity theft or other misuse of your lost/stolen ID card.

### Who needs it?
Any individual in Austria who has lost their ID card or had it stolen should follow this procedure. 

## Procedure

1. Contact your local police station: You should report the loss or theft of your ID card to your local police as soon as possible. It's important to provide them with all the relevant information about when and where you lost the card or believe it to have been stolen.

2. Apply for a replacement: After reporting the loss/theft, you will need to apply for a replacement ID card. You'll usually do this at your local municipality or "Gemeinde" (in larger cities, these would be district offices - "Magistrat‚Äù).

3. Pay the replacement fee: There is a cost associated with replacing your ID card, which you will need to pay at the time of your application.

4. Wait for your replacement card: Once your application has been processed and the replacement fee paid, you will need to wait for your replacement ID card to be issued. The timelines for this can vary, so it's best to check with your local municipality or district office.

## Required Documents
- A form of identification, such as a valid passport or driver's license
- A photograph that fulfills the passport requirements
- Proof of your place of residence, such as a recent utility bill
- Copy of the police report

## Additional details
Note that the ID card will not be issued immediately. Once you submit your application and pay the replacement fee, you may have to wait for a few days before you can pick up your new ID card. The exact waiting time can vary depending on the processing times of your local office.
