2. Once arrived in Austria, register your initial arrival with the local Authority within three days.
3. Gather the necessary documents (see below).
4. Apply for your Residence Permit at the immigration office in Austria relevant to your locality. The Migration Office in Austria [MA 35](http://www.wien.gv.at/english/) is responsible for this in Vienna.
