## Description
### What is it?
A Death Certificate is an official document issued by a government body, certifying a person's death. This document is crucial for several reasons, such as accessing the deceased's estate, claiming life insurances, and other bureaucratic procedures.

### Who needs it?
Any person directly related or involved in the legal and administrative processes following the death of an individual is likely to need this certificate. This includes next-of-kin, legal executors, and others involved in managing the deceased's estate.

## Procedure
1. Gather all required documents.
2. Go to the local Standesamt (Register office) in the city where the death occurred.
3. Submit the application along with the required documents. 

## Required Documents
1. Proof of Identity (passport, identity card, driver's license).
2. Proof of Relationship (birth certificate, marriage certificate, partnership certificate proving relationship to the deceased).
3. Death declaration: This is a document issued by the hospital or attending medical officer that confirms the person's death. If the person did not die in hospital, the police must be informed, who will then issue a declaration of death.
4. Registration form: The form can be collected from Standesamt or downloaded from their official website.

## Additional details
The cost varies depending on the number of copies required and the purpose of the certificate. It's usually below â‚¬30. It is advisable to get multiple copies of the death certificate, as numerous institutions will need an original. Note also that certificates in languages other than German may require an additional translation fee.
For foreigners living in Austria, the Standesamt will likely also report the death to their home country's embassy.
