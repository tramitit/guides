## Description
### What is it?
This is a comprehensive guide detailing the steps to be followed for registration into universities in Austria, specifically for international students, both from EU and Non-EU countries, interested in undertaking undergraduate and graduate programs.

### Who needs it?
This guide is ideal for international students looking to study in Austria and need information about the admission procedures, required documents, and how to obtain them.

## Procedure

1. For admission as an international student, initiate the process by scanning through different universities and courses to find a suitable match for your study preferences.

2. Make an application directly to the Austrian University of your choice. Each university has its own application form which could either be in German or English.

3. Fill in the application form carefully, ensuring all the details are correctly entered and all the necessary documents are attached.
