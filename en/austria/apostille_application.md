## Description

### What is it?
An apostille is an international certificate comparable to a notarization in domestic law and is often needed for documents that are required for official use in another country. It's typically necessary for anyone who plans to live, work, or study in a foreign country and needs to present official documents from their home country.

### Who needs it?
Individuals planning to live, work, or study in a foreign country, particularly if they need to show proof of education, employment history, civil status, or other personal details to authorities abroad.

## Procedure

1. Identify which document needs an Apostille. This might be birth certificates, degrees, criminal records, marriage certificates, etc.
2. Contact the issuing institution or relevant authorities and ask them to issue a copy of your document for the purposes of an Apostille.
3. Send the document to the competent authority in your home country. That might be the state or province, under the auspices of the Secretary of State or comparable official, the Ministry of Justice, Foreign Affairs, etc.
4. Pay the Apostille fee.
5. Wait for the Apostille to be processed and sent back to you.

## Required Documents

- The original document to be apostilled
- Photocopy of Identity Document (ID).
- Application form completed and signed
- Payment receipt for the Apostille service if carried out online.

## Additional details

 Each Apostille is unique and contains a registration number, which can be used to check its authenticity in an online system. It's important to remember that an Apostille only verifies the origin of the public document to which it relates: it certifies the authenticity of the signature or stamp/seal of the person or authority that signed or sealed the public document, and the capacity in which this was done. It doesnâ€™t certify the content of the public document to which it relates.
 

Remember to check with the authorities or entities requesting your document whether they require it to be apostilled. Also, keep in mind that the process may take a few weeks, so plan this well in advance of your application deadlines or departure date.
