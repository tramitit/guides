## Description
### What is it?
A study grant in Austria, often referred to as Studienbeihilfe, is a financial aid service provided by the government to aid students from low-income families in their studies at university or similar institutions.

### Who needs it?
The financial aid is aimed at students who are residents of Austria, or who meet certain criteria if they are EU/EEA or Swiss citizens. Also, it may apply to students from other countries who have gained a certain legal status. 

## Procedure
1. Check your eligibility: It is important that you meet the eligibility criteria for a study grant in Austria. Generally, these include age limits, academic achievement, residency status, and income limits.
2. Apply online: Applications for the study grant are only accepted online through the following portal: [Studienbeihilfe Portal](https://www.stipendium.at/english-information/).
3. Funding period: The funding period for the academic year starts on October 1st and ends on September 30th of the following year. However, students can apply for the grant throughout the year. 
4. Document submission: After the online application, certain documents must be submitted to the Austrian Agency for International Cooperation in Education & Research (OeAD). These include proof of identity, proof of income or residency status, and academic achievement.
5. Response Time: Submission and response times may vary but the decision should be expected within a few weeks.

## Required Documents
There is certain information you must provide for your application including:
- Identity proof (such as a passport)
- Income information (such as tax return or salary slips)
- A record of academic achievement or proof of enrollment at an Austrian university.
- Proof of residency, if required.
- Other specific documents depending upon the specific scholarship or grant you are applying for.

Obtaining these documents are typically from government or academic sources like Internal Revenue Service (for tax returns), university you are studying at (for academic records), and similar.
