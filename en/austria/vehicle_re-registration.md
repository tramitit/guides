## Description
### What is it?
Vehicle re-registration refers to the process of formally recording a change in vehicle particulars or change of the vehicle's owner with appropriate regulatory bodies. In the context of Austria, you need to re-register your vehicle when moving within Austria or importing a vehicle from another country.

### Who needs it?
Any individuals who reside in Austria and have either recently moved within the country or imported a car from another EU country need to re-register their vehicle.

## Procedure
1. When changing residence within Austria: Go to the registration office (Zulassungsstelle) in your new area within a month of the move. Here, you'll receive new plates and documents.
2. When importing a vehicle from another EU country: First, ensure the foreign registration papers include a COC (Certificate of Conformity). Then, schedule an appointment for a "Begutachtung nach ยง57a" check at an authorized garage to get your car approved for Austrian roads.
3. Finish the registration process at your local Zulassungsstelle by presenting the required documents.

## Required Documents
- Proof of identity (an identification card or passport).
- Current vehicle registration documents.
- The certificate of a successful Hauptuntersuchung if the vehicle is older than 3 years.
- Proof of ownership (bill of sale).
- Proof of residence (Meldezettel).
- A valid "Pickerl" (sticker).
- For imported vehicles: COC (Certificate of Conformity) for EU vehicles, this might be included with your foreign registration documents.

## Additional details
You may need insurance coverage for your vehicle during the move, or when bringing a car into Austria from another country. It's advised to check with local insurance providers or consult your current insurance for overseas coverage.
You'll also need to consider the potential payment of NoVA tax when importing a car, especially from non-EU countries. This might make importing vehicles from such regions economically impractical.
