## Description
### What is it?
A Criminal Record Certificate is an official document that details an individual's past legal convictions, if any exist. The certificate is essential for various reasons including job applications, visa applications, and for certain legal procedures.

### Who needs it?
Typically, individuals who are applying for jobs that require a high degree of responsibility and trust, such as positions within the government or jobs involving contact with children or vulnerable adults, need it. It can also be required for other instances such as visa or permit applications for living or studying abroad.

## Procedure
1. Determine the competent authority in your country for the issuance of the Criminal Record Certificate. Depending on where you live, it might be a local court, police station, or a specific government department.

2. Request an application form from the relevant authority. This could involve visiting the location in person or downloading the form from the official website.

3. Fill in the application form accurately with your personal details including your full name, birth details, and residential address.

4. Provide any additional documents that are required.

5. Submit the completed application form along with the required additional documents and applicable fee to the competent authority either in person or online, depending on available options.

6. Once your application is processed, you will receive your Criminal Record Certificate. The turnaround time will depend on specific authorities and regions.

## Required Documents
- Valid proof of identity (such as a Passport or Driver's License)
- Proof of residence (such as utility bill or rental agreement)
