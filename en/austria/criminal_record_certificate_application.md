### What is it?
A Criminal Record Certificate is an official document that details an individual's past legal convictions, if any exist. The certificate is essential for various reasons including job applications, visa applications, and for certain legal procedures.

### Who needs it?
Typically, individuals who are applying for jobs that require a high degree of responsibility and trust, such as positions within the government or jobs involving contact with children or vulnerable adults, need it. It can also be required for other instances such as visa or permit applications for living or studying abroad.

## Procedure
1. Determine the competent authority in your country for the issuance of the Criminal Record Certificate. Depending on where you live, it might be a local court, police station, or a specific government department.
