## Description
### What is it?
A reordered Marriage Certificate is a duplicate of the original marriage certificate. It is an official document that proves two people are married. If your original marriage certificate gets lost, damaged, or destroyed, you may need to reorder the marriage certificate.

### Who needs it?
Anyone who has lost, misplaced, or damaged their original marriage certificate can reorder a marriage certificate.

## Procedure

1. Identify your country's vital records office: Different countries have different departments handling these affairs. Locate yours (Generally, a health department or the bureau of vital statistics).
2. Application form: Access the application request form for a copy of your marriage certificate. This application form may be found on your relevant national or state government website.
3. Complete the form: Answer all required information such as your full names as they appear on the marriage certificate, date of the marriage, place of the marriage, and reason for needing the certificate.
4. Pay the fee: There could be a small fee for processing your request. The fee amount will be specified on the application form or the website.
5. Submit the application: You can generally submit your application online, by mail or in person, depending on what your governmental institution offers.
6. Wait for it to arrive: Delivery time of the certificate will vary based on processing times and the delivery method chosen (mail, pickup, or online).

## Required Documents

- A valid, government-issued photo ID
- Information about the marriage (date, location, full names of the couple)
- Payment for the processing fee

**Please note:** Requirements might vary slightly based on your local regulations.
