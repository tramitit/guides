## Description
### What is it?
Housing allowance is a financial aid provided by the government to eligible citizens to assist them with their rental costs. These programs are common in countries like Austria or The Netherlands, providing substantial financial relief to those who qualify.

### Who needs it?
These allowances are targeted to citizens who are living on low income or those who are struggling with high rents relative to their income.

## Procedure
1. Assess your eligibility: Both in Austria and The Netherlands, there are certain considerations like income, type of dwelling, age, and size of household that determine your eligibility for a housing allowance.
2. Fill out the appropriate form: In Austria, you would need to apply for a Wohnbeihilfe. In The Netherlands, you would need to apply for a Rent Allowance (Huurtoeslag).
