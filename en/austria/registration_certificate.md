## Description
### What is it?
A Registration Certificate, also known as Meldezettel in Austria, is a document that officially registers your place of residence in the country.

### Who needs it?
Anyone residing in Austria for more than three days. This applies to Austrains and immigrants alike, as well as short-term and long-term residents. 

## Procedure

1. Find a place to stay: You need to have an address in Austria to register. 

2. Fill out the Registration form (Meldezettel): You can download the form online or pick it up from the registration office ('Meldeamt'). [Download form](https://www.wien.gv.at/amtswege/meldeservice/meldezettel.html)

3. Get your landlord's signature: It's legally required for landlords to sign the form. 

4. Submit the completed form: Present the signed form within three days of moving to your new place at a local registration office ('Meldeamt'). This has to be done in person as online acceptance isn't available.

## Required Documents

- Completed Registration form (Meldezettel)
- Passport or other id-proof
- Document for proof of right of residence for non-EU/EEA nationals
