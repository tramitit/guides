## Description
### What is it?
A driver's license is a legal document that certifies the holder is qualified to operate different types of motor vehicles on public roads. 
In Austria, the process of obtaining a license includes theoretical and practical exams, as well as specific medical requirements.

### Who needs it?
Any individual intending to drive motor vehicles on public roads within Austria is required to have a valid driver's license.

## Procedure
1. Register for a driving course at a certified driving school. This course will cover both theoretical and practical aspects of driving.
2. Attend the course and pass the theory test. Typically, you'll receive a textbook or online materials for self-study.   
3. Complete the mandatory driving hours.
4. Undergo a first-aid course.    
5. Undergo an eyesight test.

9. Upon passing the exam, you'll receive a temporary driver's license which is valid for 6 months. In this period, the Driving License Authority will issue the driver's license (credit card format).
