## Additional details
Keep in mind that the Schengen area including Austria, has a policy of requiring a verpflichtungserkl√§rung or "obligation letter" from a host in order to allow certain non-EU citizens to visit. Make sure to check with the Austrian Embassy/Consulate regarding any such requirement. Be aware that processing times can vary greatly depending on the time of year and the specific circumstances of your application.
