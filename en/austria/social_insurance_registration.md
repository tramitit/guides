### What is it?
Social Insurance Registration entails enrolling in a country's social insurance system. Social Insurance provides various benefits such as healthcare, unemployment benefits, and retirements pensions among others. 

### Who needs it?

2. If you're self-employed, you're responsible for registering yourself with the SVA (Sozialversicherungsanstalt der Selbst√§ndigen) [website](https://www.sva.or.at/cdscontent/?contentid=10007.763672&portal=svaportal). 

3. Apply for your e-card, which also acts as your proof of insurance. 

4. All procedures can be done online or at their respective offices. 

## Required Documents

1. Employment contract or proof of self-employment
2. Passport or National ID

## Additional details
The cost of social insurance is based on your income and employment status. Employers usually pay half of the insurance contributions. For self-employed individuals, contributions are calculated based on their income. 

Remember, having an active social insurance account is required by law for all workers in Austria and ensures access to healthcare services among others.
