2. If you're self-employed, you're responsible for registering yourself with the SVA (Sozialversicherungsanstalt der Selbständigen) [website](https://www.sva.or.at/cdscontent/?contentid=10007.763672&portal=svaportal). 

3. Apply for your e-card, which also acts as your proof of insurance.

## Additional details
The cost of social insurance is based on your income and employment status. Employers usually pay half of the insurance contributions. For self-employed individuals, contributions are calculated based on their income. 

Remember, having an active social insurance account is required by law for all workers in Austria and ensures access to healthcare services among others.
