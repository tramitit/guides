## Description
### What is it?
A building permit is a legal permission granted by the appropriate governmental department, permitting an individual or a company to undertake construction works in a property. 

### Who needs it?
Any individual or entity looking to construct, renovate, or alter a building/property in Austria.

## Procedure

1. Security and Neighborhood Approval: Even before applying for the permit, ensure that the planned building doesn't pose any security risks and it's not violating any neighborhood/community rules.
2. Proposal: Prepare a detailed proposal of the intended construction or alterations. The proposal should adhere to the local building codes and regulations.
3. Submission of Application: Submit your proposal application to the local planning department.
4. Documentation: Along with the proposal, submit all required documents for approval.
5. Initiate Review: The local authority then commences a thorough review of the submitted proposal and documents.
6. Building Plan Assessment: A formal site assessment may be carried out to ensure the proposed plan is in compliance with laws and regulations.
7. Approval: After successful review, the building permit application is approved, and a permit is officially issued.

## Required Documents
The required documents may vary based on the nature of the construction or renovation work. Generally, the required documents include:

- A valid form of identification
- Proof of ownership
- A detailed construction plan
- A site layout showcasing the property boundaries and setbacks
- Structural plans
- Consent letters from neighbors (if required)

## Additional details
- If you're planning to buy a forest land in Austria intending to cut trees and build a house, you'll need an additional permit from the forestry Commission.
- In cities like Vienna, even for installing an air conditioner in the apartment, a permit might need to be procured if the exterior appearance of the building is going to be altered.
- Every state in Austria has its own building order, so rules and regulations may vary slightly. It's best to check with the local authorities in your area.
