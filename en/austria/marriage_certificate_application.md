## Description
### What is it?

The marriage certificate application is the process, by which couples apply to get a legal recognition of their marital status in Austria. Once issued, this document proves the legality of your marriage, which is essential for various administrative procedures such as legal name changes, obtaining residence permits, etc.

### Who needs it?

Any couple, including both EU and non-EU citizens intending to get married and live in Austria need to undergo this process.

## Procedure

1. **Establish legal residency in Austria:** Before you can apply for a marriage certificate, you must first establish legal residency in Austria either through employment, studying, or other valid means.

2. **Gather necessary documents:** These include proof of identity (passports), proof of residency (Meldezettel in Austria), and birth certificates. If one of you is non-EU/EEA citizen, you will also need proof of legal status or visa in Austria.

3. **Visit the local register office (Standesamt):** Here, you will submit your documents and fill in the application form for the marriage certificate.

4. **Pay the necessary fees:** Ensure that you have enough money to pay the required fees at the register office.

5. **Wait for your application to be processed:** The time required for the application to be processed varies, so give yourself ample time before any planned wedding dates.

If you are a non-EU/EEA citizen married to an EU citizen residing in Austria, you can apply for a residence permit that allows you to live and work in Austria. In the case of a non-EU citizen married to an Austrian citizen, the non-EU spouse may also have the option of seeking permanent residency. Please note that additional rules and requirements may apply, and you should seek clarification from local authorities or legal advisors.
