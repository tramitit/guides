## Description
### What is it?
The Residence Permit Renewal is a process that allows you to extend your stay in Austria legally. It's a mandatory requirement for non-EU/EEA/Swiss citizens wishing to reside in Austria for over six months.

### Who needs it?
Any foreign nationals - students, workers, or other individuals - who plan to stay in Austria for longer than six months need to go through this process before their current residence permit expires.


## Procedure
1. Start the renewal process at least three months before your current Residence Permit expires.

2. Request an appointment with the MA35, the immigration authority. You may need to try several times to get an appointment, so don't get discouraged.

3. Make sure to go for your appointment with all the necessary documents.

4. After successfully submitting your application and documents, you will have to wait for a while until your permit is processed. Waiting times can vary, between few weeks to several months. The MA35 don't usually specify how long it takes.

5. Once your application is approved, you will receive a notification. Your renewed residence permit can then be picked up from the appointed office.

## Required Documents
* Valid passport
* Your current residence permit
* Proof of sustainable income (e.g., employment contract, payslips, bank statements)
* Evidence of personal health insurance
* Rental contract or proof of accommodation
* For students, proof of enrollment in school/university might be additionally required

## Additional details
MA35 sometimes can be unresponsive. Patience is key, and you may need to send multiple emails or make multiple calls to get a response. 
Also, everything should ideally be completed in German, so getting help from a German-speaking person could be beneficial if you are not fluent in German.
