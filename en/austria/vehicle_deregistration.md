## Description
### What is it?
Vehicle deregistration is the process of officially removing a vehicle from the road, thereby nullifying all attached obligations like insurance, road tax, etc. This procedure is frequently carried out when the vehicle has become unusable, is being scrapped, sold, or transferred to a different country.

### Who needs it?
Owners of vehicles that are no longer in use, or being transferred out of Austria, need to deregister their cars to avoid unnecessary costs and of responsibilities.

## Procedure
1. Prepare all documents necessary for vehicle deregistration, as listed below in the section required documents.
2. Make an appointment for vehicle deregistration at a local Registration office.
3. Attend the scheduled appointment and submit all required documents to the Registration office.
4. Pay the deregistration fees.

## Required Documents
* Vehicle registration document
* Proof of identity (ID card, passport)
* Proof of address (official document confirming your residency)

Please note that, in some cases, you may also need to show proof that the vehicle has been disposed of responsibly.

## Additional details
It's essential to understand that failure to deregister a vehicle can result in continuous charges related to vehicle ownership such as insurance premiums or taxation. Always ensure to keep a proof of deregistration as it may be required for future reference or legal purposes.
