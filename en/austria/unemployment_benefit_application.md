## Description
### What is it?
Unemployment benefits (Arbeitslosengeld) are payments made by the state or other authorized bodies to unemployed people. You can apply for it if you lose your job and cover the period from your job loss until you find a new job or the maximum period for which benefits are available.

### Who needs it?
Individuals who have recently become unemployed and are currently looking for work. 

## Procedure

1. When you become unemployed, immediately register yourself as unemployed at your local AMS (Public Employment Service Austria) office.
2. After registering, you will have to personally go to the AMS office for a consultation. In this meeting, a counsellor will discuss your next steps and employment options.
3. Following the consultation, you can then apply for Arbeitslosengeld.
4. You will need to provide supporting documents along with your application.
5. Once the application is processed, you will start receiving benefits.

## Required Documents
- Proof of identity (passport or identity card)
- Confirmation of registration with AMS
- Proof of the last salary received (salary statements for the last six months)
- Termination letter from the employer

## Providers that can do it for you
No providers available. The application process to apply for the unemployment benefit is administered by the Public Employment Service Austria (AMS).

## Additional details

- The amount of unemployment benefit received is calculated as a percentage of your average earning during your employment.
- The maximum length of receiving the benefit is based on how long you've previously worked and your age.
- You are generally expected to actively look for a job and show proof of your job search activities at regular intervals.
- Failure to comply with AMS rules can result in sanctions including reduction or suspension of the benefit.
