## Description
### What is it?
Company formation is the process of legally incorporating a business as a limited company at federal level. Once a company is formed, it is treated as an individual entity by the law, separate from its owners.

### Who needs it?
This guide is suitable for entrepreneurs, small business owners, or anyone planning to start a business in Austria.

## Procedure
1. Choose a business name and check its availability. The name should not infringe on existing trademarks. You can check the name availability on the [Austrian Patent Office's website](https://www.patentamt.at/en/).

2. Determine the company's legal form. Depending on the size and type of the business, you can choose between different types of companies such as a Gesellschaft mit beschr√§nkter Haftung (GmbH) or an Aktiengesellschaft (AG).

3. Prepare the necessary documents including the articles of association, memorandum of association, and others.

4. Register the company with the [Austrian Business Register](https://www.justiz.gv.at/). 

5. Obtain necessary permissions and licenses from relevant Austrian authorities, depending on the company's activities. For example, if you're starting a business that involves food service, you'll need to obtain necessary permits from regional health and safety authorities.

## Required Documents
The documents required for company formation in Austria include:
1. Articles of Association: This document details the company's operations and structure. It outlines rules for shareholders and directors.
2. Memorandum of Association: This document contains information about the company's members and share capital.
