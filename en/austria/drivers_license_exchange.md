## Description
### What is it?
Exchanging an international driver's license refers to the process of acquiring a local driving permit in a foreign country, often by surrendering the driving license obtained from your original country. 

### Who needs it?

## Procedure

1. Find out if your native country's license can be exchanged in your new country of residence.
2. If your license is eligible for exchange, gather the necessary documents. See the section below for what is typically required.
3. Make an appointment with the local driving license authority to submit your documents and application.
4. Complete any required exams or lessons, if necessary.
5. Wait for your new license to arrive, typically by mail.

## Additional details

- The process and requirements may vary based on your nationality and the specific requirements of the country you are in. Always check with local authorities for the most accurate information.
- In some cases, an international driver's permit may be required or may allow you to avoid exchanging your license altogether.
- Depending on local laws, you may be allowed to drive for a certain period of time (often 6 months) with your foreign license before it must be exchanged.
- Be aware that your original license will often be retained by the local authorities when it is exchanged - make sure to make copies for your records if needed.
