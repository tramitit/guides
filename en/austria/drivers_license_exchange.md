Exchanging an international driver's license refers to the process of acquiring a local driving permit in a foreign country, often by surrendering the driving license obtained from your original country.

## Additional details

- The process and requirements may vary based on your nationality and the specific requirements of the country you are in. Always check with local authorities for the most accurate information.
- In some cases, an international driver's permit may be required or may allow you to avoid exchanging your license altogether.
- Depending on local laws, you may be allowed to drive for a certain period of time (often 6 months) with your foreign license before it must be exchanged.
- Be aware that your original license will often be retained by the local authorities when it is exchanged - make sure to make copies for your records if needed.
