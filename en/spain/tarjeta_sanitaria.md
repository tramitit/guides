## Description

### What is it?

The Tarjeta Sanitaria (Health Card) is a personal and non-transferable document that certifies the right of its holder to receive the benefits of Spanish Social Security health care.

### Who needs it?

Any resident in Spain, including expats, students, workers, retirees, among others.

## Procedure

1. Register as a resident in Spain.
2. Make sure you have Spanish Social Security coverage.
3. Consult your nearest "Centros de Atención e Información de la Seguridad Social" or CAISS. [Here is the page](http://www.seg-social.es/wps/portal/wss/internet/InformacionUtil/44516/44518) with the office's information.
4. Attend your appointment and provide necessary documents (see Required Documents section below).
5. After your application is approved, your card should be sent to you by mail.

## Required Documents

- The application form, available [here](http://www.seg-social.es/wps/portal/wss/internet/Trabajadores/Afiliacion/10535/13450).
- NIE (Numero de Identidad de Extranjero) or TIE (Tarjeta de Identidad de Extranjero).

## Additional details

Form filling and appointment booking might be required to be done in person. Call your nearest CAISS office to inquire about specific prerequisites. You may also need to book an appointment to apply for your tarjeta sanitaria. This depends on each CAISS office. Also, remember that accessing health services without the tarjeta sanitaria can result in hefty fees. Therefore, it's quite essential to obtain it. The card will usually arrive by post to your Spanish address within a couple of weeks of your successful application.
