## Description
### What is it?
A death certificate is a legal document issued by a government authority that declares the date, location, and cause of a person's death. It is essential for various legal and administrative purposes.

### Who needs it?
A death certificate is needed by the immediate family members, legal representatives, and sometimes government authorities and institutions like banks or insurance companies to settle the deceased's affairs.

## Procedure
1. **Identify the Civil Registry Office**: Locate the Civil Registry Office for the area where the death occurred. Civil registries in Spain are managed by the Ministry of Justice, and you can find the relevant office at the nearest location to where the death happened.
   
2. **Gather Necessary Information**: Obtain key details about the deceased, such as full name, date of birth, and date of death. 

3. **Submit a Request**: Go to the Civil Registry Office with the required documents (as listed below) and submit a request for the death certificate. This can often be done online through the Ministry of Justice or in person.
   
4. **Verification Process**: The request will be processed, and the office will verify the information provided. The certificate is usually issued within a few days, depending on the backlog.
   
5. **Collection**: Collect the document from the Civil Registry Office or arrange for it to be sent to you.

## Required Documents
- **Identification Documents**: Government-issued ID of the person making the request.
- **Proof of Relationship**: Documentation proving the relationship to the deceased if relevant.
- **Information on the Deceased**: Full name, birth date, death date, place of death.
- **Application Form**: Filled application form specific to the registry office.
