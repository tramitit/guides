## Description
### What is it?
Work authorization for students is a legal provision that allows international students to undertake work in Spain, subject to certain conditions. It permits non-EU citizens to both study and work in the country.

### Who needs it?
This is ideal for international students (non-EU nationals) who want to study in Spain and at the same time, desire to make a living or gain work experience in the country. 

## Procedure
1. Secure Admission: The first and most crucial step is gaining admission into a Spanish university. Your admission acceptance letter is required for the process.
   
2. Apply for a Student Visa: After securing admission, apply for a student visa at the nearest Spanish embassy/consulate in your home country.

3. Arrive in Spain: After your student visa is approved, travel to Spain.
   
4. Apply for Work Authorization: Approximately 3 months before starting work, apply for a work permit at the "Extranjeria" or foreigner's office. The application form is known as “Autorización de Trabajo por Cuenta Ajena."
   
5. Start Work: Once your work permit is approved, you can legally start your job.

## Required Documents
1. Admission acceptance letter from a Spanish University.
2. Student visa from Spanish embassy/consulate.
3. Work permit application form known as “Autorización de Trabajo por Cuenta Ajena."
4. Passport or national identity card.

## Additional details
1. It's important to note that the work must not interfere with the student's educational activities.
2. Students are generally awarded a work authorization that is valid for the duration of their contract, up to a maximum of the duration of their currently valid stay.
3. After you complete your studies, you may switch from a student visa to a work visa, although this process may require you to return to your home country and apply for a work visa through the Spanish embassy.
4. The spouse of a student permit holder can also apply for work authorization in Spain, although their permit will be tied to the status of the student.
