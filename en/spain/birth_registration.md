## Description
### What is it?
Birth registration in Spain is a legal requirement for all newborns, and it formally recognizes a baby's birth and citizenship. This registration results in a birth certificate, which is a vital legal document needed throughout a person's life.

### Who needs it?
This service is necessary for all parents or guardians who have recently had a baby in Spain. It is also required for those who need to use their birth certificates for legal processes, such as acquiring a passport or getting married.

## Procedure

1. Generally, the hospital where the birth occurred will provide the information necessary for the birth registration, including a medical certificate of birth.
2. The birth registration should be completed at the Civil Registry ([Registro Civil](https://www.mjusticia.gob.es/BUSCADOR/registrocivil/Index.htm)) in the municipality where the birth occurred. Note that you may need to book an appointment.
3. You'll need to provide the required documents (see below) and complete an application form at the Civil Registry.
4. Once all the information is verified, the official will register the birth. 

## Required Documents

You typically need to present the following documents to register a birth:

- Medical Certificate of Birth, which is usually provided by the medical institution where the birth occurred.
- Parents' Identification (passport or DNI for Spanish citizens)
- Family Book (Libro de Familia), if applicable. You can request this at the Civil Registry.

Note: If parents are not Spanish citizens, additional documents may be required, such as residence certificates or passports from home countries.

## Additional details
It is recommended to register the birth as soon as possible after it occurs, ideally within the first week. If you cannot register the birth yourself, you can authorize a representative to do it on your behalf. The procedure is free of charge, but there may be related costs if you request additional copies or legalized versions of the birth certificate.
