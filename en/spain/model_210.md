## Description
### What is it?
Model 210 is the Spanish tax form required for non-residents who earn income from Spanish sources. This includes rental income, capital gains, and other taxable income. It ensures that non-residents meet their tax obligations in Spain, avoiding penalties and legal issues.

### Who needs it?

## Procedure

1. Determine if you have income from Spanish sources, such as rental income or capital gains.
2. Gather all necessary documents including property contracts, rental agreements, and financial statements.
3. Fill out the Model 210 form, either digitally on the Agencia Tributaria website or on paper.
4. Calculate the tax due based on your specific type of income and applicable tax rate.
5. Submit the completed form and pay any tax due by the designated deadline to avoid penalties.


## Required documents
