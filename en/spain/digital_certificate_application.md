## Additional details

Since the application process might be a bit cumbersome due to language differences and administrative procedures, be ready to explore support forums and expat communities to navigate the process successfully. Keep in mind that you might need to have a sufficient level of Spanish to complete the application process, as the forms and instructions may not be available in English. 

Also, remember that browsers like Google Chrome or Edge might face issues while downloading and installing your certificate, hence it is advised to use Internet Explorer or Firefox for the process instead.
