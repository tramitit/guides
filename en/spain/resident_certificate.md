## Description
### What is it?
A resident certificate in Spain, commonly referred to as "Certificado de Registro de Ciudadano de la Unión" or simply the "green NIE", is a document proving that you are a legally registered resident in Spain. This certificate is necessary for various administrative and legal purposes such as opening a bank account, enrolling in the public healthcare system, and more.

### Who needs it?
- EU citizens planning to stay in Spain for a period of longer than three months.
- Individuals who need to prove their residency status for legal or administrative reasons.

## Procedure
1. **Obtain a White NIE**: Before applying for the green NIE, ensure that you have already obtained a white NIE, which is typically issued upon your legal entry to Spain.
   
2. **Gather Required Documents**: Compile the necessary documentation, including:
    - Passport or valid ID
    - Proof of employment or financial solvency
    - Proof of address in Spain
    - Completed application form EX-18

3. **Schedule an Appointment**: Use the official Spanish Government website to schedule an appointment at the nearest "Oficina de Extranjeros" or police station that handles foreign registrations.

4. **Attending the Appointment**: Bring all the gathered documents to your appointment. Additionally, bring photocopies of each document. Be prepared to pay an administrative fee, which can usually be done at a nearby bank.

5. **Receive the Certificate**: After your documents are reviewed and approved, you will receive your green NIE certificate, confirming your resident status.

## Required Documents
- **Passport or valid ID**: Ensure it is up to date and bring both original and copies.
- **Proof of employment or financial solvency**: This can include a work contract, bank statements, or proof of sufficient funds.
- **Proof of address**: A rental contract, utility bill, or a "padrón" certificate, which you can obtain from your local town hall.
