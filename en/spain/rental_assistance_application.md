## Description
### What is it?
Rental assistance application is a process that one must undergo in order to receive financial assistance for paying rent. This process involves verifying one's income and rental needs, filling out a rental assistance application form, and submitting the form to the issuing authority. 

### Who needs it?
Rental assistance may be needed by individuals or families who are struggling to pay their rent or have faced unexpected financial hardships. This service can significantly alleviate financial stress, and ensure that individuals maintain a safe and affordable housing situation.

## Procedure
1. Determine if you're eligible for rental assistance. For most programs, your income must be below a certain level. Furthermore, you may need to prove that you're facing financial loss due to specific hardships.
2. Find the correct rental assistance program that suits your needs. Different programs may have different eligibility requirements or benefits offered.
3. Collect all necessary documentation. This usually includes proof of income, identification, and a document showing proof of residence.
4. Fill out the rental assistance application. This typically involves providing your personal information, income details, and housing situation.
5. Submit the rental assistance application. The application must typically be submitted to a governmental or nonprofit organization that offers the program.

## Required Documents
- Proof of identification such as a Driver's License, passport or any government issued ID.
- Proof of income to verify your earnings. This could be a pay stub or a letter from your employer.
- Proof of residence such as a lease or statement from your landlord.
