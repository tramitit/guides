## Description
### What is it?
Maternity leave is a legal right for pregnant women to take off a certain amount of weeks from work before and after the birth of their child. In Spain, this duration is typically 16 weeks, which can be extended under certain conditions.

### Who needs it?
Any working woman who is expecting a child and wishes to take time off from work for the birth and care of her child needs to apply for maternity leave.

## Procedure

3. Fill out the application for maternity leave through the Spanish Social Security website.
4. Submit the completed application along with all required documentation to your employer and to the Spanish Social Security.  
5. Await the decision on your application. If approved, you'll receive an official letter stating the start and end dates of your leave.
