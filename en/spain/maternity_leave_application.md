## Description
### What is it?
Maternity leave is a legal right for pregnant women to take off a certain amount of weeks from work before and after the birth of their child. In Spain, this duration is typically 16 weeks, which can be extended under certain conditions.

### Who needs it?

2. Consult your doctor to determine the expected due date of your child. The doctor's note will be necessary when applying.
3. Fill out the application for maternity leave through the Spanish Social Security website.
4. Submit the completed application along with all required documentation to your employer and to the Spanish Social Security.  
5. Await the decision on your application. If approved, you'll receive an official letter stating the start and end dates of your leave.
