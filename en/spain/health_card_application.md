## Description
### What is it?
The Health Card, or the 'Tarjeta Sanitaria Europea' (TSE), is a personalized and individual document which certifies your rights to receive necessary health care benefits in Spain.

### Who needs it?
The health card is essential for anyone residing in Spain, whether a citizen, permanent resident, or a digital nomad with a visa.

## Procedure
1. First, you need to request your Foreigner's Identity Number (NIE). You can request it online [here](https://sede.policia.gob.es/NieCertificado/).
2. To request your health card, you need to make an appointment at your local Social Security office. You can do this online [here](https://www.seg-social.es/wps/portal/wss/internet/Inicio).
3. When going to the Social Security office, bring all required documents. They will process your request. After a few days, you can collect your card from the same office.

## Required Documents
- Your NIE card certifying that you're legally residing in Spain. 
- Documentation proving that you're working in Spain.
- If you're a resident family member of an EU citizen, you need your residency card.
