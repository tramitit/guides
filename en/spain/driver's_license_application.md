## Description
### What is it?
This guide provides detailed instructions on how to apply for a driver's license in Spain. The process involves both online and in-person steps, which are conducted through the Spanish Traffic Department (DGT).

### Who needs it?
This guide is particularly valuable for non-residents and foreign residents who are planning to drive in Spain.

## Procedure
1. **Set up an appointment**: You need to schedule an appointment with the DGT, which can be done on [this website](https://sedeapl.dgt.gob.es:7443/WEB_NCIT_CONSULTA/solicitarCita.faces). 

2. **Get an eye and psychotechnical examination**: It's necessary to get these tests done at a certified center (called "Centros de Reconocimiento de Conductores"). They will verify your physical and mental capabilities for driving and send the result directly to the DGT.

3. **Submit your documents and application**: On the day of your appointment, you have to go to the DGT with your paperwork. It usually takes about a couple of hours. Pay the necessary fees at the appointment.

4. **Wait for your driver's license**: After your application is processed and approved, your new driver's license will be sent to your Spanish address via courier. 

## Required Documents
- Valid identification (Passport).
- Proof of address
- Spanish residency permit (if applicable)
- Original driver's license
- Two passport-size photographs
- Medical certificate from a DGT-approved center as a result of your eye and psychotechnical examination.

## Additional details

- The process can take several weeks, so it's advised to start well in advance of when you need the license. 
- Keep in mind that all documents must be in Spanish, so if they are in another language, they need to be duly translated and notarized. 
- You can drive with your original license until you receive the Spanish one, but ensure that it's valid for use in Spain.
