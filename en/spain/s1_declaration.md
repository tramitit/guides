## Description

### What is it?

The S-1 Declaration is a crucial document required by the Spanish authorities to declare any money you have moved to Spain. This declaration is used by the Spanish authorities to monitor financial flows within and into the country.

### Who needs it?

Any individual who has moved money to Spain from another country, regardless of whether they have acquired residency status, should complete the S-1 declaration.

## Procedure

1. Ensure all the funds you will be declaring have been moved to Spain.
2. Visit the official website of the Agencia Tributaria, Spainâ€™s tax agency.
3. Download Form S1 [(Formulario S1)](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/nuevasede.html).
4. Fill in all the necessary details including identification information and details of the money moved.
5. Ensure you have all the necessary supporting documents ready.
6. Submit the completed S1 form and the supporting documents to Agencia Tributaria.

## Required Documents

1. Your Passport or National Identity Card
2. Bank statements detailing the money moved to Spain
3. Any additional documents that justify the origin of the funds

## Additional details

You must declare your funds within one month of their arrival in Spain. It's best to keep a personal copy of your S-1 declaration, as the Spanish authorities can request it at any time. If, for whatever reason, you are unable to complete the S-1 declaration yourself, a third party may do so on your behalf, provided they present a valid document proving your authorization.
