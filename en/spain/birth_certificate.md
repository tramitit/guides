## Description
### What is it?
A birth certificate in Spain is an official document issued by the Civil Registry that records the birth of a person. It includes information such as the individual's full name, date of birth, place of birth, and the names of their parents.

### Who needs it?
Individuals who need to prove their birth details for various purposes such as obtaining identification documents (like a DNI/NIE), registering for school or social services, or for genealogical research.

## Procedure
1. **Determine the Civil Registry Office**: Locate the specific Civil Registry Office where the birth was registered. This could be in the municipality where the person was born.

2. **Prepare Identification**: You may need a valid form of identification such as a DNI or passport. If obtaining a certificate on behalf of someone else, additional documents (like a power of attorney) might be required.

3. **Visit the Civil Registry Office**: Attend the office in person to request the birth certificate. You may need to fill out a request form and present the identification documents mentioned above.

4. **Request Online or by Mail**: Alternatively, many Civil Registry offices allow you to request a birth certificate online through their official website or by sending a written request via mail.

5. **Pay Applicable Fees**: Be prepared to pay any applicable fees for the issuance of the birth certificate. Fee structures may vary between regions and the mode of request.

6. **Receive the Certificate**: Once the request is processed, you will receive the birth certificate either in person, by mail, or digitally, depending on the application method you chose.

## Required Documents
1. **Proof of Identity**: A valid DNI, passport, or other identification document.
2. **Authorization Document**: If requesting on behalf of another person, a power of attorney or similar authorization document may be needed .
3. **Completed Request Form**: Usually provided by the Civil Registry Office or available online.
