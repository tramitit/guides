## Description
### What is it?
Stateless status refers to the condition of an individual who is not considered as a national by any state under the operation of its law. Such individuals are defined as "stateless persons," and this condition could arise due to a variety of reasons, including political, social, or legal factors.

### Who needs it?
The ideal candidates for stateless status are individuals who find themselves without nationality due to circumstances beyond their control, such as the dissolution of their country, changes in political regimes, or discriminatory laws that exclude certain groups. This status is vital for those seeking protection and the ability to live a normal life without the fear of persecution or lack of legal identity.

## Procedure
1. **Eligibility Check**:
   - Confirm that you do not hold nationality from any country and understand the rights and obligations associated with stateless status.

2. **Initial Consultation**:
   - Seek guidance from legal aid organizations or consult with immigration attorneys who are experienced in dealing with stateless persons.

3. **Gather Documents**:
   - Collect evidence that supports your stateless status claim, including birth certificates, previous nationality documents, and any correspondence from state authorities denying your nationality.

4. **Submit Application**:
   - Apply through your host country’s relevant immigration or asylum services. For example, in Spain, this can be done via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or related governmental bodies.

5. **Attend Interview**:
   - Be prepared for an interview where you will discuss your personal history and the reasons you cannot be recognized as a national by any country.

6. **Wait for Decision**:
   - The processing time may vary, so it is essential to be patient and monitor your application status regularly.

7. **Receive Decision and Statutory Benefits**:
   - If approved, you will receive documentation certifying your stateless status and access to certain rights, benefits, and social services in your host country.

## Required Documents
* Birth Certificate: Required to prove your place and date of birth.
* Identity and Travel Documents: Any available documentation from previous countries of residence.
* Proof of Previous Nationality and Correspondence: Documents or letters from authorities showing you are not recognized as a national.
* Affidavits or Witness Testimonies: Where applicable, to support your claim of statelessness.
* Legal Advice and Support Documentation: Recommendations or letters from legal aids or NGOs that have assessed your status.

## Additional details
Statelessness comes with significant disadvantages, including denial of basic rights and services. It is critical for affected individuals to seek immediate assistance, as prolonged statelessness can severely impact one's quality of life and legal standing. Various non-governmental organizations and United Nations bodies, such as the UNHCR, play a significant role in aiding stateless individuals globally.

For further information on statelessness and rights associated with it, refer to organizations and legal frameworks dedicated to the protection and integration of stateless individuals.
