## Description

### What is it?
An extension of short stay is a legal process through which individuals who are in Spain for a temporary period (typically for tourism or short-term work purposes) can extend their stay beyond the initial period allowed by their visa or entry conditions. 

### Who needs it?
Individuals who are in Spain under a short-term visa or stay permit (less than 90 days) and find themselves needing to extend their stay due to unforeseen circumstances, such as health issues, business needs, or other valid reasons.

## Procedure

1. **Determine Eligibility**: Ensure you have a valid reason for requesting an extension (such as health, family, or professional reasons) and that your current short stay permit allows for an extension.

2. **Prepare Documentation**: Gather all required documents (listed below). Ensure all documents are in Spanish or translated by an official translator.

3. **Fill Out Necessary Forms**: Complete the relevant application form for an extension, typically the EX-00 form is used for such procedures. Forms can be found on the [Spanish Ministry of Interior’s website](https://www.inclusion.gob.es/documents/410169/2156469/00-Formulario_estancia.pdf).

4. **Submit Application**: Submit your application and supporting documents to the local immigration office (Oficina de Extranjería). This can often be done in person. 

5. **Pay Fees**: Pay the required processing fees. Ensure you keep the receipt as proof of payment.

6. **Await Decision**: The processing time can vary, but you should be prepared to wait several weeks. Keep checking for any communications from the immigration office, and respond promptly if any additional information is requested.

7. **Collect Decision**: Once your extension request is processed, you will be notified of the decision. If approved, ensure you keep the documentation with you at all times during your extended stay.
