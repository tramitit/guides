## Description
### What is it?
Spanish nationality by residence is granted to foreigners who have legally resided in Spain for a specified duration and meet certain other criteria. This pathway allows individuals to obtain Spanish nationality through continued legal residence.

### Who needs it?
Foreign nationals who have been legal residents in Spain for a sufficient period of time and wish to attain Spanish nationality. Typically, this includes residents on work or study permits, people with family connections, or those who have been granted asylum. 

## Procedure
1. **Determine Eligibility**: Confirm that you have legally resided in Spain for the required period:
   - General rule: 10 years
   - Refugees: 5 years 
   - Citizens of Ibero-American countries, Andorra, Philippines, Equatorial Guinea, or Portugal: 2 years
   - Individuals married to a Spanish citizen or born in Spain: 1 year

2. **Gather Required Documents**: Collect necessary documents including, but not limited to, your passport, residence permit, birth certificate, proof of legal residence, criminal record certificate from your home country and Spain, and proof of sufficient financial means.

3. **Prepare for the CCSE and DELE Exams**: Pass the Constitutional and Sociocultural Knowledge of Spain (CCSE) and, if your native language is not Spanish, the DELE A2 exam or higher.

4. **Complete Application**: Fill out the nationality application form. Ensure all information is correct and every field is filled out.

5. **Submit Application**: Submit your completed application, along with all required supporting documents, at the Civil Registry where you reside or online through the Spanish Ministry of Justice's website.

6. **Attend an Interview**: You might be called for an interview at the Civil Registry. Be prepared to answer questions about your residence, intentions, and integration into Spanish society.

7. **Wait for Resolution**: After submission, wait for the resolution. This period can vary, but typically takes around 1-3 years. You can check the status of your application online.

8. **Oath of Allegiance**: Once your nationality is granted, you must take an oath of allegiance to the King and the Constitution of Spain at the Civil Registry.

9. **Register as a Spanish Citizen**: Finally, register your Spanish nationality in the Civil Registry to obtain your Spanish ID and passport.
