## Description
### What is it?
Applying for a EU Resident Card is the process by which non-European Union residents can legally reside in an EU member state. This guide specifically outlines the process for Spain but may involve similar steps for other EU countries.
### Who needs it?
This procedure is required for any non-European Union citizen who intends to live, work or study in an EU member state for a period exceeding 90 days.

## Procedure

1. Gather necessary documents (see `Required Documents` section below). It's advisable to have both originals and copies of all documents.
2. Fill in the application form. It can be downloaded from the Spanish immigration [website](http://www.interior.gob.es/web/servicios-al-ciudadano/modelos-de-solicitud/extranjeria).
3. Book an appointment with your nearest Spanish Embassy or Consulate, or with the relevant department if you are already in Spain. This can typically be done through their respective websites.
4. Attend your appointment and submit your application, ensuring you bring all the correct documentation.
5. If your application is approved, you will need to provide a biometric data, usually only fingerprints.
6. Your resident card will be issued, typically within 1-3 months. You will need to pick it up in person at the location specified by the authorities.
   
## Required Documents
The following documents are typically required:

- Completed application form
- Valid passport (non-EU)
- 2 recent passport size photos
- Proof of health insurance
- Evidence of sufficient financial resources
