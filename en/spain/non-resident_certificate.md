## Description

### What is it?
The non-resident certificate is a document that certifies an individual's non-residential status in a country. This certification is often required for various administrative or banking processes, such as opening a non-resident bank account.

### Who needs it?
Any individual who cannot or does not intend to establish residency in Spain but requires an official document to certify their non-resident status for legal, financial, or administrative purposes.

## Procedure

1. **Obtain a White NIE**: If you haven't already, you need to obtain a NÃºmero de Identidad de Extranjero (NIE), which can be applied for at Spanish consulates.
   - **External Link**: [Spanish Consulates](https://www.exteriores.gob.es/es/EmbajadasConsulados/Paginas/index.aspx)

2. **Book an Appointment at Your Local Police Station**: Visit the national police website and book an appointment at your local station in Spain.

   - Valid passport.
   - Completed EX-15 form (application for NIE).

4. **Pay the Fee**: Pay the fee for the issuance of the non-resident certificate. This can often be completed at a designated bank.

5. **Submit Your Documents**: Present the paid fee receipt and all documents at your local police station to finalize the process.
