## Description

### What is it?
A Student Card or TIE (Tarjeta de Identidad de Extranjero) is the Spanish foreigner identity card. As an essential document, it serves as proof of your legal residence and student status in Spain. 

### Who needs it?
Non-European Union students who are in Spain for a study program longer than six months are required to apply for a student card. 

## Procedure 

1. Within 30 days of arriving in Spain, book an appointment online via [this site](https://sede.administracionespublicas.gob.es/icpplus/).
2. Choose the province where you live & select the option "Toma de Huellas - Extranjeros".
3. Fill out the online form, write down the appointment's date/time, and generate a PDF copy.
4. Prepare the documents necessary for your appointment.

## Required Documents 

- Passport (original and photocopy) with the student visa.
- Three recent color passport-size photographs.
- Proof of economic means (a bank statement showing that you can financially support yourself during your studies).
- Proof of health Insurance coverage in Spain.
- Proof of paid fees (model 790, code 012) which can be paid online [here](https://sede.policia.gob.es/Tasa790_012/ImpresoRellenar).

## Additional details 

Empadronamiento or municipal registration is also necessary if planning to stay beyond the duration of three months. It must be done at the local town hall (Ayuntamiento). Remember that bookings for TIE appointments fill up quickly, so scheduling early is highly recommended. 

Note: This process might vary slightly depending on the region. Always check with your university or local consulate for precise requirements.
