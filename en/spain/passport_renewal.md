## Description
### What is it?
Renewing a passport is essentially getting a new passport issued once your previous one has expired or is about to expire. This guide will walk you through the process of renewing your passport in Spain.

### Who needs it?
Individuals with a passport that is getting expired or has less than 6 months of validity remaining, and those who are about to travel internationally.

## Procedure

1.  First, make an appointment on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website at [cita previa exteriores](https://sede.maec.gob.es/citaconsularprevia/en/consulado.html).
2.  Select your local Consulate or Embassy from the drop-down using your autonomous region as a reference.
3.  Select the service option: Passport renewal.
4.  You must fill up an application form. The passport application form can be downloaded from [here](https://www.policia.es/documentacion/requisitos.html).
5.  Once the form has been completed, you should bring it, along with required documents, to the consulate for submission.
6.  After the application is submitted, you can collect your new passport from the consulate when it’s ready.

## Required Documents

- Old Passport
- DNI (National Identity Document) for Spanish nationals
- Two recent passport size photos
- Proof of payment of requisite fee

## Additional details

The passport renewal process may take several days or weeks depending on individual circumstances and appointment availability. 

It is always advisable to start your renewal process well in advance of any planned travel to avoid any unforeseen delays. Late applications may require you to pay for expedited processing. In Spain, it's particularly recommended to renew your passport if it has 6 months or fewer left until expiry. 

In case you are a dual citizen (US-Spain), you do not need to have a valid US passport to live or travel to the US, only the Spanish passport. But, you do need a valid US passport to re-enter the US. You should renew it before your trip or check for a US Embassy once you're in Spain.
