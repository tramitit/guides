## Description

### What is it?

A Spanish Social Security Number is a unique identifying number assigned to residents in Spain. It is essential for various activities such as applying for jobs, accessing healthcare, and dealing with all kinds of government paperwork.

### Who needs it?

Every resident in Spain, whether temporarily or permanently, will need to apply for a Spanish Social Security Number.

## Procedure

1. To apply for a Spanish Social Security Number, you should first find an office of the Social Security Treasury General (Tesoreria General de la Seguridad Social) nearest to you.

This can be done online via their [website](https://sede.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/sede/sede/Ciudadanos/CiudadanoDetalle/!ut/p/z1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8ziPR0dnA3dnQ28_U2DXA093AOMjQwtDIx8TYCz1C7IdFQEcyt0M/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/). You will need to select the Social Security registration option (alta en Seguridad Social).

3. You will need to fill up the form [TA.1](https://www.seg-social.es/wps/portal/wss/internet/Trabajadores/Afiliacion/10938/37850) (which is the general Social Security Affiliation form), which can be downloaded online.

4. After you fill out the form, you should bring your completed form and other required documents to your appointment at the Seguridad Social office.
