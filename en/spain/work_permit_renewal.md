## Description
### What is it?
Work Permit Renewal is the process of extending your existing work authorization when your current permit is about to expire. This allows you to continue legally working and residing in Spain.

### Who needs it?
Foreign nationals who are currently working in Spain and have a valid residence permit that is near its expiry date need this. 

## Procedure
1. Check the date on your work permit to prepare for your renewal three months before it expires. 
2. Gather all necessary documentation (details below). 
3. Fill out the necessary forms. This would be in the renewal package provided by the Immigration Office.
4. Submit your application in-person at the Immigration Office. 
5. Wait for your renewal to be processed. This could take up to 3 months, hence the need for early application.
6. Collect your renewed work permit from the Immigration Office upon notification of completion.

## Required Documents
- Valid Passport
- Current Work Permit
- Proof of continuous employment like an employment contract, recent pay slips, or a letter from your employer.
- Proof of address (usually a utility bill or rental agreement)
- A completed application form for work permit renewal, available from the Immigration Office.
