## Description
### What is it?
A registration card in Spain (often referred to as a NIE - Número de Identidad de Extranjero) is a document that non-Spaniards need to conduct various legal and fiscal activities in Spain, such as opening a bank account, signing a lease, or starting employment.

### Who needs it?
Non-Spanish nationals planning to stay in Spain for more than 3 months, study, work, or conduct economic activities. This includes EU and non-EU citizens.

## Procedure
1. **Make an appointment**: Visit the official Spanish government appointment website (https://sede.administracionespublicas.gob.es/) and make an appointment at the nearest Oficina de Extranjeros or national police station.

2. **Fill out the form**: Complete the Modelo EX-15 or EX-18, depending on whether you are an EU citizen (EX-18) or a non-EU citizen (EX-15). You can download it from the official website (https://www.interior.gob.es).

3. **Prepare your documents**: Gather all required documentation (see list below).

4. **Attend the appointment**: Bring all your completed forms and required documents to your appointment. Be prepared to explain why you need a NIE.

5. **Pay the fee**: You may need to pay a fee for the issuance of the NIE. Check online or at the appointment for the exact amount and how to pay it.

6. **Collect the NIE**: In some cases, you will receive your NIE on the spot, but it can also take a few days to weeks. Ensure you inquire about the processing time during your appointment.

## Required Documents
- **Passport**: Your original passport and a copy of the photo page.
- **Completed Application Form**: Modelo EX-15 or EX-18, depending on your nationality.
- **Proof of Address**: A rental contract or a utility bill showing your address in Spain.
- **Proof of Appointment**: Confirmation of your online appointment.
- **Social Security Number**: If applying for a TIE (Tarjeta de Identificación de Extranjero) for work purposes, you may need to include it.
- **Photographs**: Recent passport-sized photos (check the exact number needed as per local office instructions).
- **Payment Proof**: Proof of payment of the NIE issuance fee (use Modelo 790 - https://sede.policia.gob.es/Tasa790_012/).
