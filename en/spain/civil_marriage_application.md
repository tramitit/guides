## Description
### What is it?
A civil marriage application is a procedure you need to initiate to legalize a civil marriage in Spain. It involves submitting application forms, certain required documents, and complying with various legal requirements.

### Who needs it?
This process is necessary for those who intend to get married in Spain, as well as foreign couples who want their marriage, which happened outside Spain, to be registered and recognized by Spanish Law.

## Procedure
1. Start by requesting an appointment in the corresponding Civil Registry.
2. Submit the required documents (see list below).
3. Attend a formal interview to verify all the information you've provided is accurate.
4. If your file is approved, the Civil Registry will issue your marriage license within 40-60 days.
5. With the license, you can proceed to arrange your wedding ceremony.
6. After the wedding, the Civil Registry will issue your marriage certificate.

## Required Documents
- Application form duly filled out.
- Original and photocopy of valid passports.
- Original and photocopy of birth certificates, translated into Spanish if required.
- A certificate of No Impediment to marry if required, translated into Spanish.
- Certificate of residence or 'Empadronamiento'.
- In case you are a divorced person, you must submit a decree absolute of your divorce.
- If you are a widow or widower, you will need to provide the death certificate of your previous spouse.
- For foreign nationals, a Certificate of Consular Inscription may be required.

* Please note that all the documents should be officially translated into Spanish (if they are in another language) and be legalized according to Spanish laws.
