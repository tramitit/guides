## Description

### What is it?
Model 130 is a quarterly tax form in Spain for self-employed individuals and small business owners to declare their income and calculate their payment of personal income tax. It’s a necessary procedure to ensure compliance with the Spanish tax regulations.

### Who needs it?
Self-employed individuals (autonomos) and small business owners in Spain who earn income from their business activities need to complete and submit Model 130.

## Procedure

1. **Gather Necessary Information**: Before starting, collect all relevant invoices and documents related to your income and expenses for the quarter.
   
2. **Access the Model 130 Form**: Obtain the form from the Spanish Tax Agency (Agencia Tributaria) website. You can download the form directly from their [official site](https://www.agenciatributaria.es/).

3. **Fill in Personal Information**: Enter your personal details including your full name, address, and NIF (Número de Identificación Fiscal).

4. **Enter Income Information**: Log the total income earned in the respective quarter. This should include all invoiced amounts.

5. **Deduct Expenses**: Subtract your business expenses from your income. These can include costs related to operational activities, equipment, utilities, etc.

6. **Calculate Taxable Income**: The resulting figure after deducting expenses from income is your taxable income for the quarter.

7. **Apply Deductions**: If eligible, apply any specific deductions that you qualify for based on Spanish tax laws.

8. **Calculate Tax Due**: Determine the tax amount you owe by applying the relevant tax rate to your taxable income. Spain usually applies a progressive tax rate, so confirm the rate applicable to your income bracket.

9. **Submit the Form**: You can submit the filled form online via the Agencia Tributaria website or submit it physically at the local tax office.

10. **Make Payment**: Ensure you pay any tax due by the deadline to avoid penalties. Payments can typically be made through bank transfers or direct debit.

## Required Documents

- **Invoices**: Detailed invoices of all income earned during the quarter.
- **Expense Receipts**: Receipts of all business-related expenses.
- **Previous Tax Returns**: Copies of previous Model 130 submissions if applicable.
- **Bank Statements**: Statements showing payments received and expenses paid.
