## Description
### What is it?
The Residence Card of a Family Member of a European Union citizen is a document that allows non-EU family members to reside legally in Spain, tied to their EU citizen family member. This card facilitates their living, working, and traveling within the EU.

### Who needs it?
This card is required for non-EU family members of EU citizens who intend to live with their EU relative in Spain. These family members generally include spouses, registered partners, children, and dependent relatives.

## Procedure

1. **Initial Research and Appointment Booking**
   - Visit the [Extranjería website](https://sede.administracionespublicas.gob.es) to book an appointment (cita previa) at the local immigration office (Oficina de Extranjería).

2. **Gather Required Documents**
   - Assemble the necessary documents, ensuring they are translated and apostilled if required. Document specifics are provided in the "Required Documents" section below.

3. **Attend Appointment**
   - Attend the appointment with all the required documents. Present these documents to the immigration officer.

4. **Fingerprinting and Submission**
   - After submitting your documents, you will be asked to provide your fingerprints. This step is crucial for issuing your residence card.

5. **Resolution Period**
   - Wait for the administrative decision. The processing time usually varies, but you will be notified once the card is ready for collection.

6. **Collect Your Card**

4. **EU Citizen’s ID**
   - A copy of the EU citizen’s passport or national ID.

5. **Proof of Residence in Spain**
   - Document that proves the EU citizen’s residence in Spain, such as a rental contract, property deed, or registration certificate (Empadronamiento).

6. **Health Insurance**
