## Description
### What is it?
The EU Resident Card or Tarjeta de Identidad de Extranjero (TIE) is the residency identification for non-EU citizens in Spain. This card is issued for the duration of your stay, and must be renewed accordingly.
### Who needs it?
Non-European Union citizens who are residing in Spain for an extended period of time and have their card set to expire soon.

## Procedure
1. **Prepare required documents**: Gather all required documentation well ahead of time.
2. **Complete application form**: Fill out the [`Modelo EX-17`](https://sede.administracionespublicas.gob.es/modelosoficiales/) form for the renewal of the card, providing all necessary information.
3. **Pay the Fee**: Pay the corresponding fee (`Tasa 012`), which can be done at a local bank using the `Modelo 790` form.  
4. **Set an appointment**: Make an appointment online via the [public services website](https://sede.administracionespublicas.gob.es/icpplus/), selecting your province and identifying the procedure as “Policía- Expedición de Tarjeta de Identidad de Extranjero (Huella)".
5. **Submit application**: Attend your appointment, and submit the application form along with the required documents and payment receipt. You may have to provide fingerprints during this time.
