## Description
### What is it?
Unemployment benefits ("paro") is a type of social security net provided by the Spanish government for individuals who have become unemployed involuntarily. This provides a source of income while job seekers look for another job.

### Who needs it?
Anyone who has become involuntarily unemployed in Spain and has contributed to the Spanish Social Security for a minimum of one year (360 days) is eligible to apply for unemployment benefits.

## Procedure
1. Register as a jobseeker at your local unemployment office (Oficina de Empleo).
2. Submit an application for unemployment benefits online through the official SEPE website ([www.sepe.es](http://www.sepe.es/)), or at your local SEPE office (Servicio Público de Empleo Estatal).
3. It's important to apply within 15 working days after your last day of work.
4. Once you’ve submitted your application, you’ll receive a text message or email confirmation.
5. You'll be given an appointment to discuss your situation and confirm your claim.

## Required Documents
- DNI (Spanish Identity Card) or NIE (Foreigner Identification Number)
- Social Security card
