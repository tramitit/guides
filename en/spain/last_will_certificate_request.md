## Description

### What is it?
A Last Will Certificate (Certificado de Ãšltimas Voluntades) is a document that certifies whether a person has made a will in Spain and where it is located. 

### Who needs it?
This certificate is essential for those who need to settle an estate in Spain, particularly if the deceased had assets or property in the country.

## Procedure

1. Wait 15 working days after the death of the person before applying for the certificate. This allows time for the will to be registered.
2. Write an application to the Ministry of Justice. The application should be in Spanish and include the deceased's full name, date of birth, and the date and place of death.
3. You will need to provide an original death certificate with a Hague Apostille. If you do not have this, you can request it from the [Central Civil Registry Office](https://www.mpr.gob.es/Paginas/index.aspx).
4. Pay a small fee for the certificate. The fee can be paid at a bank or online.
5. Submit the application and the receipt of the fee payment to the registry office. You can do this by post or in person. The [address](https://www.mpr.gob.es/Paginas/index.aspx) is:
    Ministry of Justice
    Central Office of Citizen Services
    Plaza Jacinto Benavente, 3
    28012 Madrid
    Spain
6. Wait for the certificate to be published. It usually takes about 10 business days. 

## Required Documents

- Original death certificate with the Hague Apostille
- Receipt of payment for the certificate fee
- Application to the Ministry of Justice
