## Description
### What is it?
The Certificate of Registration of an EU Citizen is an official document that registers EU citizens living in Spain. This certificate serves as proof of legal residence in the country and is often referred to as the "green NIE" due to its green card format.

### Who needs it?
Any EU citizen planning to stay in Spain for more than 90 days needs this certificate. It is essential for those intending to live, work, or study in Spain.

## Procedure
1. **Make an Appointment**
   - Schedule an appointment at the local "Oficina de Extranjería" or police station where foreign nationals are registered. This can often be done through the official government website or by visiting the location in person.
   
2. **Prepare Your Documents**
   - Gather all required documents (see the list below for specifics).

3. **Attend the Appointment**
   - Bring your documentation and attend the scheduled appointment. Be prepared to present your documents and answer any questions.

4. **Receive Your Certificate**
   - Once your application is processed and approved, you will be issued the Certificate of Registration. This is often provided on the same day of the appointment if all documents are correct.

## Required Documents
- **Passport**: Valid passport and a copy.
- **NIE Number (Número de Identificación de Extranjero)**: The white NIE, if you have received it as an interim document.
- **Proof of Employment**: Work contract or a letter from your employer.
