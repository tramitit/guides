## Description
### What is it?
Return Authorization is a necessary process if you want to return a purchased product for a refund or exchange. This involves informing the seller about the product issue and obtaining consent to return the product.

### Who needs it?
Anyone who has purchased a product, found it unsatisfactory, damaged, or not in accordance with personal needs. Return authorization is also needed by individuals who need to return to Spain without having the necessary paperwork at times.

## Procedure
1. Contact the customer service department of the company from which you bought the product.
2. Present the issue you have with the product and inform them about your decision to return the item.
3. If approved, the service representative will provide you with a Return Authorization.
4. Depending on the company policies, you may be required to print out the authorization and attach it to the returning package.
5. Send the product back to the company using the shipping methods described by the retailer.

## Required Documents
To apply for a Return Authorization, you may need the following documents:
1. Proof of purchase such as an invoice or receipt.
2. Any other document that the company might require like an ID or warranty/ guarantee card.
