## Description
### What is it?
Financial aids available for large families to help them manage their financial challenges. These aids often come in the form of grants, subsidies, discounted services, etc.

### Who needs it?
Large families struggling with financial burdens, especially those with several children and only one or two income earners could greatly benefit from this.

## Procedure

1. Identify the aid programs: The first step is to identify the aid programs that your family is eligible for. You should look at both federal and local programs, as both can provide significant help.

2. Apply for the Programs: Each program will have its application process. Some will require you to fill out an application form while others might need you to provide a letter stating why you need the assistance. Be prepared to provide all necessary information and documentation. 

3. Wait for Approval: Once you've submitted your applications, you'll need to wait for approval. The length of time this takes can vary by program, but you should typically hear back within a few weeks.

## Required Documents
You might need these documents:

- Identification documents for all family members
- Proof of income (such as pay stubs or tax returns)
- Evidence of family size (such as birth certificates or school records)
- Proof of residency (such as a utility bill or lease agreement)

Providing these documents might differ depending on the program you are applying for.
