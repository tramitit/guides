## Description

### What is it?
In Spain, the Driver's License Renewal is a process required to renew the validity of your driving license after it has expired. It includes verification of identity, an eyesight test and, dependant on age, a basic health checkup.

### Who needs it?
Any driver whose driving license is about to expire or has already expired.

## Procedure
1. Schedule an appointment with the Dirección General de Tráfico (DGT). This can be done via their website (https://sede.dgt.gob.es/es/tramites-y-multas/cita-previa/jefaturas/).
2. Attend your appointment bringing all required documents. Expect to have a basic health check-up (including an eyesight test) at this appointment, so it's recommended not to drive to this appointment.
3. Pay the renewal fee. The cost varies, but it's typically around 24 euros.
4. Wait for your new license. DGT will issue a temporary license for you to use during this period. The waiting time can be up to 2 months, although it's usually faster.

## Required Documents
- An official identification document (DNI or NIE for foreigners)
- The old driving license
- A recent digital passport-size photo
- Proof of payment of the renewal fee
