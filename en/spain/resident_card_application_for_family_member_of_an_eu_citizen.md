## Description
### What is it?
The Resident Card Application for Family members of an EU citizen is a process which allows non-EU family members of EU citizens residing in Spain to establish their legal residency in the country.

### Who needs it?
This process is necessary for non-EU family members of an EU citizen who intend to live, work, or study in Spain for more than 90 days.

## Procedure
1. First, you need to make an appointment at the Foreigner's Office (Oficina de Extranjeros) or a Police Station that has a Foreigner's Department. You can do this online at [this link](https://sede.administracionespublicas.gob.es/icpplus/index.html). You'll need your passport details to make the appointment.
2. Once you've got your appointment, you'll need to gather all the necessary documents (listed below).
3. On the day of your appointment, bring all your documents and copies with you. Don't forget to take your EU family member's ID as well. 
4. Fill in the application form and submit it along with the rest of the documents.

## Required Documents
- Original Passport along with copy
- Proof of relationship with EU family member such as marriage certificate or birth certificate
- Proof of health insurance coverage 
- Proof of economic means, to show that the EU citizen can support the non-EU member. 
- EU family member's resident card or ID
- Three passport size photos

## Additional details
Before rushing the appointment, ensure you have all documents ready. Documents that you obtain from your country need to be properly translated into Spanish and apostilled. It is also a good idea to have your EU family member with you during the procedure. The process can take up to 3 months for the card to be ready for pick up, but you'll have a A4 size paper that serves as temporary residence document. If you leave Spain in the meantime, it is advisable to have a return ticket and this paper as proof of your application. 

Some regions in Spain (like Madrid) require the EU member to register in the community before their family member can apply for the card, so be sure to check local regulations.
