### What is it?
The Permanent Residency Certificate in Peru is an essential document that provides legal permission for expatriates to reside in Peru indefinitely. It grants the holder various rights similar to those of Peruvian nationals, such as the ability to work, access public services, and travel in and out of the country freely. The process involves multiple steps including application submission, background checks, and approval from immigration authorities.

### Who needs it?
This service is ideal for expatriates planning to live in Peru long-term, including retirees, professionals with Peruvian job offers, investors, and family members of Peruvian citizens.
