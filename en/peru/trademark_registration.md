## Description
### What is it?
Trademark registration in Peru is a legal process that grants the exclusive rights to use a particular brand name, logo, or slogan in connection with specific goods or services. This ensures that the trademark is legally protected from unauthorized use by others, providing the trademark owner the exclusive right to its use and legal recourse in case of infringement.

### Who needs it?
This service is ideal for entrepreneurs, business owners, and companies looking to establish and protect their brands in the Peruvian market. It is especially beneficial for those launching new products or services, expanding their business presence in Peru, or seeking to safeguard their intellectual property against potential misuse or infringement.

## Procedure

1. Conduct a preliminary search to ensure the trademark is available and not already registered.
2. Prepare and submit the trademark application form with the Instituto Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia y de la Protecci√≥n de la Propiedad Intelectual (INDECOPI).
3. Provide a detailed description of the goods or services associated with the trademark.
4. Pay the applicable fees for the trademark application.
5. INDECOPI reviews the application to check compliance with all legal requirements.
6. If no objections or oppositions are raised, the trademark is published in the Official Gazette for a period.
7. If no oppositions are received during the publication period, the trademark is registered and a certificate is issued.
