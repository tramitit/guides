## Description
### What is it?
The DNI renewal service in Peru allows citizens to renew their Documento Nacional de Identidad (DNI), the official national identification card. This process ensures the ID remains valid for use in various official transactions and as a means of identification. The renewal can be done either online or in person, simplifying the procedure for the citizens.

### Who needs it?
This service is ideal for Peruvian citizens whose DNI is nearing expiration or has already expired. It is also essential for those who have lost their DNI and need to renew it to access banking services, apply for jobs, or undertake official transactions. Naturalized citizens and even those residing abroad can benefit from this service to retain their identification status.

## Procedure

1. Visit the official RENIEC website or local RENIEC office.
2. Pay the required fee through pagalo.pe or at authorized banks.
3. Submit your current DNI number and personal details.
4. Provide the required documents (see next section).
5. Schedule an appointment online or visit the nearest RENIEC office.
6. Attend your appointment and provide biometric data and any additional necessary documentation.
7. Wait for the notification for DNI collection or request home delivery if the option is available.


## Required documents

- Current DNI or police report if lost.
- Receipt of payment from pagalo.pe.
- Passport-sized photo (if required).
- Birth certificate (for minors).
- Marriage certificate (if applicable, to reflect change in marital status).
