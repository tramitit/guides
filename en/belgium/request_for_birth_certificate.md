## Description
### What is it?
A birth certificate is an official document that records a person's birth. It is a crucial document that you often need to provide for various administrative procedures in Belgium and abroad.

### Who needs it?
Anyone born in Belgium may need to provide a birth certificate for several reasons such as applying for a passport, getting married, or proving your nationality.

## Procedure
1. Identify the municipality where you were born. Each Belgian municipality has its civic registry where births are recorded.
2. Visit the town hall (maison communale, gemeentehuis) of the city where the birth was registered in person. If you cannot go in person, you may also send a relative or a third party.
3. Request for the birth certificate. If you send someone else, they will need written authorization from you and their ID.
4. To use the document outside of Belgium, it may be necessary to have the birth certificate apostilled or legalized.

## Required Documents
- Your identification document (passport or identity card)
- Written authorization letter and a copy of your ID if you send another person.

## Additional Details
If you need to use the birth certificate abroad, you might need to get it apostilled. An apostille makes a document recognizable in countries part of the Hague Convention by providing a seal that validates the signature on the document. You usually get an Apostille from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 

Furthermore, be aware that the birth certificate must be in the countryâ€™s language where the place of birth is located. Depending on the destination of the document, you may need to translate it and possibly submit it to a process of legalization.
