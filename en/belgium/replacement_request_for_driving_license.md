## Additional details

Please note that without a valid driver's license, you are not allowed to drive. So, try to commence the replacement procedure as soon as you lose your license or realize it has been stolen. Depending on your municipality, the timeline for replacement may vary. However, typically, you should receive a new license within 5-10 business days upon application. The cost of replacement can also vary. It's recommended to contact your local commune for accurate information. Also, an international driver's license can be converted to a Belgian license following a specific procedure as mandated by Belgian law.
