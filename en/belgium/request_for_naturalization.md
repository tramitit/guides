## Description
### What is it?
Naturalization is a legal process through which a non-citizen in a country may acquire citizenship or nationality of that country. It may be done by statute, without any effort on the part of the individual, or it may involve an application or a motion and approval by legal authorities.

### Who needs it?
Typically, this applies to immigrants or long-term foreign residents, who have fulfilled certain residency and other legal requirements.

## Procedure
1. Gather the necessary documents (as listed in the 'Required Documents' section).
2. Apply for naturalization at your local town hall (commune/gemeente).
3. There will likely be a police interview to verify your identity and residency status.
4. Submit the declarations and other legal documents for verification. 
5. The reviewing authority will then process your application and make a decision based on the documentary evidence provided and the outcome of the police interview.

## Required Documents
- Proof of Identity (Passport, Resident card etc.)
- Proof of continuous legal residence for the required period
- Police clearance certificate
- Proof of social integration (e.g., having attended integration courses)
- Proof of economic integration (supports oneself financially)

## Additional details
Please note that the naturalization process can be lengthy (typically between 6 to 24 months), and it requires continuous legal residence. The timeframes may differ depending on individual circumstances and local requirements. Legal advice should be sought as required.

Exact required documents may vary depending upon personal circumstances such as marital status, whether you have children, etc. Please verify with local commune or legal advisors.

The cost of the transaction process also varies depending on various factors, including but not limited to translation fees, legal fees, administration fees, etc. Do clarify these expenses before proceeding with your application.

And lastly, fulfilling the criteria does not necessarily guarantee the granting of citizenship as the decision ultimately lies upon the discretion of the authorities.
