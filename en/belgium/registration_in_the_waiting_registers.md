## Description
### What is it?
The waiting list registration is a system used by several institutions, such as music festivals like Tomorrowland, to allow prospective participants to sign up for a chance to purchase tickets that become available due to cancellations or additional ticket releases.

### Who needs it?
Anyone who is interested in attending an event but missed out during the general ticket sales phase, or if tickets were fully booked, can benefit from registration in waiting registers.

## Procedure
1. Go to the relevant website. This could be Tomorrowland's official website (https://www.tomorrowland.com/) for example.
2. Look for the Waiting List section. Usually, this is in the Tickets section of the website.
3. Enter your personal information. This typically includes your name, contact information, and possibly additional details depending on the event protocol.
4. Confirm your registration. Do this by following the prompts given on the website; you may need to confirm your email or perform other validation steps.
5. Wait for updates. If tickets become available, you will likely be contacted via email or through other means as specified during registration.

## Required Documents
Generally, you only need a valid and active email address for Waiting List Registrations. Certain events may also require proof of identity or other documentation, but these requirements would be specific to the website or event in question.

## Providers that can do it for you
It should be noted that typically, one must register for a waiting list personally and it cannot be done through a third party. This helps prevent ticket scalping and keeps the process fair for everyone. 

## Additional details
- It's important to note that registering for a waiting list does not guarantee you will receive tickets. It simply puts you in line should tickets become available.
- Providers typically manage their waiting lists on a first-come, first-serve basis. Some may use a lottery system.
- Ensure to check the details from the official event website or from trusted sources for specific requirements and procedures.
- Be wary of third-party sellers claiming they can secure spots for you in waiting lists, as these can often be scams. Always use official channels for registration.
