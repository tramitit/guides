## Description
### What is it?
Proof of Residence is a document that verifies a person's residential address. This may be needed for a variety of purposes, including opening a bank account, applying for loans, migration, tax purposes, or even for applying for citizenship in certain countries.

### Who needs it?
This guide will be helpful for anyone who is in the process of migrating to a new country, applying for loans or citizenship, or people who just moved and need to establish a domicile for tax or other purposes.

## Procedure
1. Settle in your new home and ensure you are receiving utility bills (electricity, water, gas, etc.) or rent agreements, bank statements that clearly reflects your name and current address.
2. Contact the utility company, bank or leasing office and request for a proof of residence.
3. Note that, some utility companies and banks may have this service available online.
4. If online service is not available, send a written request to the relevant institution.
5. Be prepared to provide personal identifying information, such as your customer or account number.

## Required Documents
You may need the following documents:

- ID or passport
- Old proofs of residence (e.g., utility bills, a lease agreement)
- Current proofs of residence (recent utility bills or rent receipts)
- Other documents might be required depending on your country of residence and the specific requirements of the institution you are requesting the proof of residence from.

## Additional details
- A Proof of Residence may be required by financial institutions or governmental entities. 
- Always double-check with the institution whether they require an original document or if a copy is sufficient.
- Some institutions may require the document to be recent (e.g., issued within the last three months). 
- In some cases, a Proof of Residence may need to be certified or notarized.
- If you don't have utility bills in your name, contact the entity requiring the Proof of Residence and ask what other documents you could use. For example, they may accept a statement from a landlord, a council tax bill, or other official correspondence.
- Some countries may have specific requirements for a Proof of Residence document as part of immigration or citizenship application procedures. Always check the requirements specific to your situation.
