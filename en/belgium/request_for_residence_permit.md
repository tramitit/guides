2. Once in Belgium, you're required to register with the foreigner's department of the municipal administration within eight days.
3. Provide all necessary documents to the municipal administration.
4. There may be other processes, determined by your specific case. Stay informed by visiting the local immigration office or website.

## Additional details
The process of obtaining a residence permit can be lengthy and requires many steps. There may be an official inspection of your residence, and often the permission isn't given before your visa expires. It is recommended to start the process as early as possible. For people who have already been living legally in Belgium for five years, they may apply for long-term resident status. Beyond this, they may be able to apply for Belgian nationality.
