## Description
### What is it?
The Belgian identity card (eID) is an official document issued to citizens of Belgium by their municipality of residence. It serves as a proof of identity and nationality and is mandatory for all citizens aged 15 and over.

### Who needs it?
Any foreigner registered and residing in Belgium and Belgian citizens aged 15 and over are required to have the Belgian eID.

## Procedure
1. Register at your local commune.
2. Once your registration is approved, you will receive an invitation letter with your PIN and PUK codes.
3. Take the invitation, along with your two recent passport photos to your local commune.
4. Pay the applicable fee, and that's it! You will receive your eID within two weeks.

## Required Documents
1. Invitation letter from the commune.
2. Two recent passport pictures.

## Additional details
- If you forget your pin, you can request for a new one at the local commune or the federal portal (https://www.ibz.rrn.fgov.be).
- Each Belgian eID carries a unique eID number, not to be mistaken with the National Register Number, which you can find on the back of the card.
- You are required to keep your address on the eID updated. If you move, you should notify your new local commune within 8 days.
- In case you misplace your eID, you are required to report the loss at your local police station and apply for a new one at your local commune.
