## Description
### What is it?
Registration in the population registers is the official process of documenting your residency in Belgium. It is required for every person who moves to Belgium. Not only does it legally recognize your residency, but registration is also essential for access to numerous services and rights, such as mandatory voting.

### Who needs it?
Any person who is living in Belgium, whether they are a Belgian citizen, a citizen from another EU country, or a non-EU national. People who are planning to stay in Belgium for longer than three months are required to register.

## Procedure
1. Visit your local town hall (Maison communale/Stadhuis) within eight working days of your arrival in Belgium.
2. Submit the necessary documents. Depending on your situation, the documents required may vary.
3. After your documents have been verified, a local police or municipal officer will visit your resident address to confirm your living situation.
4. Once the check has been done, you will receive a residence card.

Due to the nature of the procedure, it is recommended to check your local community's official website or location for further information.

## Required Documents
The specific documents required may vary depending on the situation. However, in most cases, the following documents are needed:
- Passport
- Birth certificate (translated by a sworn translator if necessary)
- Proof of health insurance
- Proof of housing
- If applicable, proof of sufficient financial means e.g., employment contract, bank statement

## Additional details
In Belgium, voting is mandatory once you're registered in the population register. This compares to some countries where voting is optional. Failure to comply with this electoral obligation can lead to penalties such as fines. In addition, the procedure mentioned could vary slightly between the different communes, so it's always recommended to check the local rules.
