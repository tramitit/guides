## Description
### What is it?
A change of address report is a declaration made by individuals to their local municipality when they move to a new residential address within the same city or town, or when moving to a different municipality.

### Who needs it?
Any individual who has moved houses within their current city/town or to a new municipality in Belgium is required by law to report this change of their official residence address.

## Procedure
1. Visit your local city hall or town hall in person within 8 days of moving in at your new address.
2. Inform the officials that you would like to declare a change of address.
3. You'll need to provide validation of your new residence, like a rental contract or property deed.
4. After completing the report, an employee from the municipality will visit your new residence for verification.
5. Post-verification, the address gets updated in the National Register and you'll receive a new residence card if applicable.

## Required Documents
1. Proof of Identity – Belgian ID card, Passport, or Residence Permit.
2. Proof of New Residence – Lease agreement, property deed, or written statement by the main resident allowing you to live there along with their ID.

## Additional details
Do keep in mind that the process and regulations may differ slightly between various municipalities. When moving to a different town or city, ensure to de-register from the previous city/town administration. Finally, notifying change of address doesn't impact services like unemployment benefits but it's crucial to keep your address updated with these institutions for seamless communications.
