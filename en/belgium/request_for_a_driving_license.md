## Description
### What is it?
A legal document that allows you to operate a motor vehicle in Belgium. For those with licenses from non-EU countries, this will often involve exchanging your current license for a Belgian one.

### Who needs it?
Any resident of Belgium who wishes to legally drive a motor vehicle on public roads, or foreign individuals planning to stay beyond the legal timeframe of their international licenses.

## Procedure
The procedure for obtaining a driving license in Belgium can vary based on certain factors, such as whether you are a new driver or are exchanging a foreign license. Following are the general steps involved:

1. If you're a new driver, enroll in a driving school and complete the mandatory theoretical and practical lessons.
2. Sit for your theory exam.
3. Obtain your provisional license, allowing you to practice driving under certain conditions.
4. Sit for your practical exam.
5. Claim your license from the local town hall. 

If exchanging a foreign license:

1. Check your eligibility. Some countries have reciprocal agreements with Belgium.
2. Submit application to local municipal administration (Administration Communale) with required documents.
3. Surrender your foreign driverâ€™s license.
4. Receive confirmation of exchange and pick up your new Belgian license.

## Required Documents
These are typically the documents required:

1. Valid identification proof.
2. Residency proof (such as your residence permit).
3. Medical certificate (if required).
4. Your current foreign driving license (if applicable).
