## Description
### What is it?
Travel authorization is a requirement for travelers who plan to visit a country as tourists or for business purposes. It's usually acquired prior to departure and is contingent upon the traveler’s nationality. For instance, US citizens planning to travel to Europe from 2021 will need to apply for a travel authorization due to changes in visa requirements.

### Who needs it?
This guide is ideal for US citizens planning to travel to Europe or other destinations that have specific visa or travel authorization requirements.

## Procedure
1. Identify if the destination country requires a visa or travel authorization. For Europe, you can check the official [EU Immigration Portal](https://ec.europa.eu/immigration/).
2. If you need to apply for a visa, select the appropriate type (tourist, business, student, etc.), gather necessary documents, pay the application fee and submit the application at the nearest consulate or embassy.
3. For travel authorization, apply through the designated online system. For Europe, US citizens will use the [European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS)](https://www.etiasvisa.com/etias-requirements/americans).
4. Fill up the form with accurate information. Provide all the necessary details including your personal information, passport details, medical information, and travel itinerary.
5. Pay the designated fee for the travel authorization.
6. Once complete, await confirmation. This can take anywhere between days to weeks, so it's best to apply well before your planned departure date.

## Required Documents
- Valid passport
- Medical and travel insurance
- Proof of financial means (Bank statement, Property proof, etc.)
- Accommodation and travel itinerary
- Return ticket (For tourist visas)

Acquiring these documents often involves pre-planning and interacting with relevant authorities to provide proof as required.
