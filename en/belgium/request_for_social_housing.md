## Description
### What is it?
Social housing in the Netherlands is rental homes for households with a moderate income. They are rented out by housing associations.

### Who needs it?
The main demographic for social housing are people with a low income who can't afford a house through the private sector.

## Procedure

1. Register for social housing – You can do this at the local municipality (Gemeente) or with a housing association.

2. Expect long waiting periods – Waiting periods in major cities like Amsterdam can be up to 10 years. However, other less densely populated regions may have shorter waiting periods.

3. Inquire about priority status – Priority status is often given to people in urgent need of a place to live such as those who are living in unsuitable conditions, those with a disability, or people who need to leave their current home due to divorce or fire.

4. Explore “first come, first serve” houses – A small portion of social houses are allocated on a first come, first served basis. Be ready to respond immediately when these houses become available.

## Required Documents

- Proof of identification
- Proof of income
- Proof of urgency (if requesting priority status)

Documents can be obtained from relevant authorities such as your bank (for proof of income) and government ID issuing organizations (for ids).

## Additional Information

* There are income requirements for registering for social housing in the Netherlands. The maximum gross yearly income is €47,325 for a single-person household or for two people over the age of 65 for a single person over the age of 23. For families of 2 people aged under 65 and families of 3 or more people, the limit is €55,114.

* Registering someone else in your social housing without permission is often forbidden and can lead to punishment such as eviction or fines. Make sure to inform your housing provider if someone else is moving in with you. 

* It’s generally advised to register for social housing as soon as you become eligible, even if you don’t need it immediately. The waiting period starts from the moment you register. 

* Asking people to lie about their income to meet the requirements for social housing or any kind of housing is unethical and can lead to severe consequences. Always provide truthful information on your application.
