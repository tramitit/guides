## Description
### What is it?
Unemployment benefit is a financial aid provided by the government for those who lose their job with no fault on their part and are actively seeking employment.

### Who needs it?
It is aimed at those who have lost their job, are currently unemployed, and actively searching for a job.

## Procedure
1. Register with the Labor Office: You should register at your local Labor Office as soon as possible after losing your job. It's essential since the unemployment benefit eligibility countdown usually starts from the date of registration rather than the date of job loss.
2. Application for Unemployment Benefit: After registering, you should apply for the unemployment benefit in person at the Labor Office. Make sure you have all the necessary documents ready.
3. Regular Checks: You are required to regularly report your employment status. The frequency of these checks varies and will be explained to you by the Labor Office.

## Required Documents
- Identification Document (ID or passport)
- Pink Slip or equivalent document showing the termination of your previous job
- Documents confirming your Social Security contributions

Note: The exact documents required might change depending on your specific situation. You should check the official Labor Office website to ensure you have all the necessary documents.

## Additional details
Remember, to be eligible for unemployment benefits, you must not only be unemployed but also actively looking for a job. The Labor Office may ask for proof of this at any moment, like applications sent or interviews attended. Also, the length and amount of the benefit can vary depending on specific variables including your past salary, past employment history, and more. It's recommended to check the Labor Office website or consult with them directly to understand better how this works.
