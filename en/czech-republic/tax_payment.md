2. Gather your income information: This includes salaries, dividends, interest from investing, etc.
3. Calculate the tax: Tax rates vary depending on the type of income and personal circumstances. Taxation of investment income, such as from ETFs, can be complex and may require professional advice.

5. Submit the tax return: This can be done online or by sending a paper copy to your local tax office.
