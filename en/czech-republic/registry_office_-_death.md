## Description
### What is it?
Registering a death in the Czech Republic involves submitting all necessary documents to the appropriate Registry office (also known as Standesamt in German).

### Who needs it?
If you are an immediate family member or executor of the will of a person who has passed away in the Czech Republic, this process is required. Registering the death helps to ensure that all legal requirements related to the event are properly observed and the deceased's records are updated.

## Procedure
1. Obtain the medical certificate of death from the doctor who confirmed the death or from the hospital where the individual died.
2. Prepare all necessary documents (see "Required Documents" section below).
3. Submit the certificate of death and all other necessary documents to the Registry Office (Standesamt) closest to the place of death.

## Required Documents
- Document of identity of the deceased (either ID card, passport, or birth certificate).
- Medical certificate of death.
- Marriage certificate (if applicable).
- If applicable, document attesting to a name change of the deceased.
- All documents should preferably be in German or Czech language in this context. If they are in English or other languages, translation may be needed.
