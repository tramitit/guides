## Description
### What is it?
Registry office marriage refers to the legal procedure of registering a marriage in an official registry office, which is a legal requirement in many countries. This process involves the submission of required documents, declaration of intention to marry and the conducting of the actual marriage ceremony by a civil officiant.

### Who needs it?
This guide is particularly useful for foreigners planning to get married in the Czech Republic. It's also necessary for anyone planning to get married in countries that require official registration of marriages.

## Procedure
1. Determine Eligibility: Check that you fulfill all the requirements necessary to get married. This includes age, nationality, and marital status requirements.
2. Gather Required Documents: Assemble all necessary paperwork. This may vary depending on the country, so be sure to research and prepare for your specific circumstances.
3. Translation of Documents: If your documents are not in Czech, youâ€™ll need to have them officially translated and notarized.
4. Submit Documents: Submit all necessary documents to the appropriate office for inspection. This usually includes but is not limited to, identification documents, proof of legal status, and proof of intention to marry.
5. Wait for confirmation: Wait for the review of your documents and receiving official confirmation.
6. Ceremony: After successful consideration, you will need to arrange a ceremony at the registry office. Both partners must attend.

## Required Documents

- Proof of legal status: Certificate that you are legally free to marry.
- Proof of Intention to Marry: A document stating that both parties intend to marry one another.
- Residency documents: Proof of residency or citizenship of the country wishing to marry in.

## Additional details
In the Czech Republic, any name changes as a result of marriage need to comply with the legal standards. Women generally have the option to take their husband's surname or keep their own. If you are a foreigner and your home country has different rules for name change upon marriage, the Czech Office of Vital Records will respect those rules.
