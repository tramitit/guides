## Additional details
- The temporary residence certificate is not the same as a residence permit. The residence certificate confirms your right as an EU citizen to stay in the Czech Republic for more than 30 days; however, it does not grant you the status of a resident.
- If you plan to stay in the Czech Republic for a period exceeding 5 years, you are entitled to apply for a permanent residence permit.  
- The health insurance coverage is available to all registered citizens, regardless of their employment status.
- You will be entitled to a parking permit once you have registered your residence.
- Keep in mind that all documents should be translated into Czech by a certified translator.
