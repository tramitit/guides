## Description
### What is it?
A parking permit allows individuals to park their vehicles in designated parking zones in the Czech Republic, primarily in certain parts of Prague. Some zones require displaying specific parking stickers or permits. 

### Who needs it?
The parking permit is essential for residents and tourists planning to use their own or rental cars to drive around Prague or other cities in the Czech Republic. Particularly, those wishing to park their cars for an extended period in designated parking zones. 

## Procedure
1. Determine the parking zone where you will attach your permit. Each parking zone corresponds to different neighborhood districts. You can check the zones [here](http://www.parkujvklidu.cz/praha/mapa/#mapaZon).

2. Gather all the required documents. 

3. Go to the respective department of transportation or parking administration building. In Prague, this is the 'Magistrat Hlavniho mesta Prahy' located at Marianky 2, 169 01 Praha 6. 

4. Fill out the application for a parking permit.

5. Submit the completed application form along with the required documents to the respective department. 

6. Pay the necessary permit fees. The cost can range depending on the type of parking permit you require.

7. Once approved, the parking permit will be issued, which you should display on your vehicle.

Note: For tourists, there are designated parking spaces available where you can park for a short period. It's also worth noting that in Prague, the Blue Zone parking is strictly reserved for residents or local companies.

## Required Documents
- Proof of residency or proof of property ownership in the Czech Republic depending on the type of permit you are applying for.
- Valid identification (Passport for foreigners).
- Car registration documents.

## Additional details
- Bear in mind that public transport in Prague is highly efficient and extensive - it might be more convenient to use this mode of transport instead of dealing with limited parking spaces.
- If you fail to adhere to parking regulations, you risk getting a fine or having your vehicle towed away.
- The parking permit does not guarantee a parking space. It only offers the right to park if a space is available.
