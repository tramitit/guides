## Description
### What is it?
An ID card, or identification card, is a document that serves as proof of identity and, in some cases, citizenship. In the Czech Republic, ID cards are issued to citizens and non-citizens with permanent residence.

### Who needs it?
Any person who resides in the Czech Republic and wishes to have a valid form of identification may need an ID card. This includes both citizens and non-citizens with a permanent residency permit.

## Procedure
1. Gather all the necessary documents (see Required Documents section below).
2. Visit the appropriate local department of the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic in person. It cannot be done online or by mail.
3. Submit the completed application form and all required documents.
4. Pay the application fee.
5. After processing, you will be notified when your ID card is ready for collection.

## Required Documents
1. Completed application form for the issue of an identity card.
2. Birth certificate.
3. Proof of citizenship (for citizens) or permanent residency permit (for non-citizens).
4. Photos complying with the requirements for identity documents.
5. Previous ID card (if applicable).

## Providers that can do it for you

There are no third-party providers who can submit an application on your behalf. The application must be submitted in person at the Ministry of Interior's local department.

## Additional details
According to the source, an ID card usually takes around 2-3 weeks to be processed and issued. The cost of application varies depending on the urgency and the applicant's age. In any case, valid proof of identity and/or status of residence is required. The specific requirements and fees can be confirmed with the Department of the Interior.
