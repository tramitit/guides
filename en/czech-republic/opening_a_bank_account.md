## Description
### What is it?
Opening a bank account is a process where an individual or an organisation establishes a banking relationship with a bank, making it possible to deposit, withdraw, or manage funds. In the context of the Czech Republic, a bank account provides access to a range of financial services including salary deposits, payments, savings, and investments. 

### Who needs it?
Anyone planning to stay in the Czech Republic for an extended time, either for work, study, or business purposes will benefit from opening a bank account. This includes both residents and non-residents.

## Procedure

1. Decide on the type of account: Current accounts are more suitable for daily financial activities while savings accounts focus more on generating interest over time.

2. Research and select a bank: Look into different banks and their offerings. Some popular banks in the Czech Republic include [ČSOB](https://www.csob.cz), [Komercni Bank](https://www.kb.cz), and [Moneta Bank](https://www.moneta.cz).

3. Visit the bank branch: Go in person to the bank of your choice to open the account. Some banks may also offer an online process.

4. Complete an application form: The bank will require you to fill an account opening form where you'll provide personal details like name, address, occupation, and identification details.

5. Provide necessary documents: Identification documents such as passport or ID card will be required. Non-residents may need to provide additional documentation.

6. Deposit an initial amount: You will be required to deposit some money to activate your account.

7. Get confirmation: After the bank has verified your information and processed your deposit, they'll give you confirmation and account details. You will also be provided with a debit card and other banking tools depending on the bank’s specific policies.

## Required Documents
Typically, the following documents are necessary:

- A valid identification document (Passport or ID card)
- Confirmation of address (utility bill, lease agreement, etc.)
- For non-residents: Residence permit or proof of staying in Czech
