## Additional details
For non-EU citizens, besides the 10-year continuous residency, other categories like refugees or family members of Czech citizens can apply for permanent residence. After 5 years of holding a permanent residence permit, individuals are eligible to apply for Czech citizenship.
Remember that the procedure and required documents might vary, so it is essential to check the official requirements on the Ministry's website. Itâ€™s also good to note that the requirements for a permanent residence permit are quite strict, and the process could be long due to the thorough examination of the applicant's documents and qualifications.
