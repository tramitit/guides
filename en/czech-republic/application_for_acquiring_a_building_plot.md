## Description
### What is it?
Acquiring a building plot refers to the process of buying land with the intent to construct a house or other structure. 

### Who needs it?
It's most suited for anyone interested in constructing a house or a building, may it be investors, families or developers.

## Procedure
1. Identifying the land: This involves looking for available plots of land that can be used for your intended construction project. Websites such as [Reality](https://www.reality.cz/) or [Sreality](https://www.sreality.cz/) may be helpful in the Czech Republic.
2. Legal Checking: Once the land has been identified, conduct a legal check to ensure that the land can be legally sold and is not burdened by right of third parties. You can do this by checking at the [Land Registry](https://nahlizenidokn.cuzk.cz/) in Czech Republic.
3. Negotiation and Agreement: Negotiate the price and terms of the sale. It's advisable to write this agreement down in form of a purchase agreement.
4. Financing: Secure financing for the land. Some financial institutions provide special loans for land purchase.
5. Purchase and Transfer: Finally, purchase the land and have the transfer recorded in the local land registry.

## Required Documents
- Purchase agreement. This legally binding document outlines the terms and conditions of the land sale. It's typically drafted with the help of a lawyer.
- Proof of financing.
- Proof of transfer. This is typically a document provided by the local land registry indicating that the land has been transferred to the new owner.

- The total cost of the project includes not only the purchase price of the land, but also the costs of construct the building.
