## Description
### What is it?
Changing a permanent residence refers to the administrative process you need to undergo when you decide to move from your current address to a new address. This includes both domestic and international relocations. 

### Who needs it?
This process is vital for anyone who is planning to move to a new address, be it within the same city, to a different city, or even to a different country. You are required to update your new address in the official records to ensure all your correspondences and services are directed correctly.

## Procedure
1. If you're relocating within the Czech Republic, you need to notify the relevant authorities about your move. This often involves filling out a form with your new address details and submitting it to the local town hall or municipal office.
2. If you're moving from abroad, you must register your new address with the Czech foreign police within 30 days of your arrival.
3. After you've successfully registered your new address, you would usually need to collect a new Resident Permit reflecting the updated information.
4. Update your address with any relevant institutions such as your bank, workplace, etc.

## Required Documents
- ID or equivalent proof of identity
- Proof of accommodation ownership or rental agreement of your new residence
- Completed registration form

## Additional details
Remember that changing your permanent residence often involves more than just updating your address with the post office. You'll also need to update it with your healthcare provider, your insurance company, your workplace, and any other organization or service that uses your physical address. If you're moving from abroad, you may also need to deal with customs and immigration, which can come with its own set of procedures and requirements.
