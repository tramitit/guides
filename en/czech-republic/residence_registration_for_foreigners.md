## Description
### What is it?
Residence Registration refers to the official process of registering your personal details and residential address with the authorities of a given country. In the context of the Czech Republic, this procedure is conducted with the Foreign Police Department.

### Who needs it?
Any foreign individual intending to stay in the Czech Republic for a period exceeding 30 days needs to register their residence.

## Procedure

1. Upon arriving in the Czech Republic, locate the nearest Foreign Police Department ([link here](https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/contacts-foreign-police.aspx))
2. Visit the department within three working days from the date of your arrival (excluding weekends and holidays) to complete your registration process.
3. Obtain the residence registration form in the appropriate language, complete it, and submit it to the officer on duty.
4. Provide all the necessary documents as required (see section below)
5. After processing, the officer will provide you with an acknowledgement of your registration.

Please note: While it is predominantly the responsibility of the individual to register their own residence, if you are staying in a hotel or any type of accommodation establishment, they might do this process on your behalf.

## Required Documents
The following documents might be necessary for successful registration:

- A valid passport
- A completed residence registration form
- Proof of accommodation (eg: Rental contract, letter from the hotel, etc.)
