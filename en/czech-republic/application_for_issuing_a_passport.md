## Description
### What is it?
The process of applying for a passport entails submitting the required documents, paying the necessary fees and, in some cases, attending an interview for verification. This is the process for securing a Czech Republic passport.

### Who needs it?
If you are a citizen of the Czech Republic, or eligible to become one, in need of a passport, you need to go through this process. 

## Procedure
1. Gather all necessary documents including birth certificate, confirmation of citizenship, 2 photographs, identity document, etc.
2. Submit these documents to your local municipal office (obecní úřad).
3. Ensure that you have paid the administrative fee.
4. Wait for your passport to be processed. This could take about 2 weeks to a month or more.
5. Once your passport is ready, pick it up from the municipal office where you submitted your application.

## Required Documents
