## Description
### What is it?
A temporary passport, also known as an emergency passport, is a travel document issued when someone's full validity passport is not available and they need to travel internationally.

6. Provide a Passport Size Photo: The requirements will vary depending on the country.
7. Provide Travel Itinerary: Proof of your upcoming travel plans such as plane/train tickets or a travel itinerary.
8. Pay the application fee: The amount will depend on the issuing country.
