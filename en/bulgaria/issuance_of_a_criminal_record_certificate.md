## Description
### What is it?
A criminal record certificate is an official document that details any criminal convictions of a person associated with their name. 

### Who needs it?
Anyone intending to work in specific sectors (such as education, healthcare), applying for firearm possession, immigration purposes, adopting a child or even moving to a new country like Bulgaria may need a criminal record certificate.

## Procedure
1. Visit the official website of the Ministry of Justice. Here is the link: [https://www.mjs.bg/](https://www.mjs.bg/)

3. Fill out the application form with your personal details, the reason for requesting the certificate and contact information.
4. Submit the form online and pay the processing fee through the indicated payment method.
5. Wait for the processing of your request which could take a few days or weeks depending on the service level.
6. Once your request is processed, the certificate will either be mailed to your designated address or you may be required to collect it in person.

## Required Documents
The documents needed could vary according to the specific circumstances and reasons for requesting the certificate. Generally, you would need:
