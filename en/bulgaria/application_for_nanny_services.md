## Description
### What is it?
Nanny Services refers to a professional full-time or part-time service provided by a skilled caretaker to look after your children in your own home. Aspects of nanny services include childcare, tutoring, light household duties and meal preparations.

### Who needs it?
This service is ideal for families who may be particularly caught up with work, need a little extra help around the house or want to ensure good care for their children in their own home while they are away.

## Procedure
1. Identify your requirements: Determine your family's needs, the nanny's work schedule and the specific duties you want your nanny to perform.
2. Search for a nanny: You can do this through online platforms, nanny placement agencies or personal recommendations from your social circle.
3. Interview potential candidates: Prepare a list of questions to ask to assess their suitability for the job. In addition, check their references, background, and work history.
4. Employment agreement: Once you've found a suitable candidate, formalize the work terms with a written agreement stating job responsibilities, salary, benefits, and other conditions.
5. Tax and insurance handling: Depending upon your location, you may have to register as a domestic employer, handle withholding taxes from the nanny's salary and provide worker's compensation insurance.

## Required Documents
- Your nanny must provide proof of identity (a valid passport, driver's license, or ID card).
- Proof of the nanny's qualifications (certificates, diplomas).
- Background check/criminal record check.
