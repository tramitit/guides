## Description
### What is it?
Heating assistance is a form of financial aid designed to help low-income households afford the cost of heating their homes during the winter months.

### Who needs it?
Ideally, any individual or family who is struggling to make ends meet and cannot afford to keep their home heated during the chilly months would benefit from this assistance.

## Procedure
1. Determine your eligibility: Typically, your household's annual income should be at or below a certain threshold.
2. Collect necessary documentation: You will need certain documents to prove your eligibility, including evidence of income.
3. Complete application: You will need to fill out an official application detailing your financial situation.
4. Submit application: This can usually be done online or at certain locations, such as a local community service agency.

## Required Documents
