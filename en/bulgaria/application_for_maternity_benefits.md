## Description
### What is it?
Maternity benefits are funds provided by the government to help support families following the birth of a child. 

### Who needs it?

## Procedure
1. Determine if you are eligible for maternity leave benefits. Depending on the country and your specific situation, eligibility requirements might vary. As a rule, you need to be working and paying national social security contributions.
2. Download and fill out the necessary application forms. This will likely require information about your employment, pregnancy, and other personal details.

4. Await government response.

## Required Documents

## Additional details
Maternity benefits and leave policies can vary greatly from country to country. It's important to research the specific policies in your country of residence to ensure that you are taking full advantage of the benefits available to you. In some cases, these can be quite generous. For example, some countries provide new mothers with substantial paid leave, allowing them to take time off work without worrying about lost income. When planning for maternity leave, it's also a good idea to discuss your plans with your employer, as they may have specific policies or benefits in place as well. These sources provide useful information and materials for applying for maternity benefits in many countries.
