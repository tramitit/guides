## Description
### What is it?
Permanent address registration in Bulgaria is a legal process required by both Bulgarian nationals and foreigners who intend to reside permanently in the country. This process includes obtaining a Personal Number of a Foreigner (PNF) which serves as identification.

### Who needs it?
Any foreign resident who wants to live, work or start a business in Bulgaria, establish their tax domicile or access social services, must go through the procedure of permanent address registration.

## Procedure
1. Apply for a long-stay visa or Bulgaria visa type D from the Bulgarian embassy/consular services in your native country. Non-EU citizens are required to do this before entering Bulgaria.
2. Once in Bulgaria, navigate to the National Revenue Agency's local office with your valid identification (passport).
3. Complete the application form provided by the National Revenue Agency. The form requires basic details like your full name, date of birth, nationality, and prospective Bulgarian address.
4. Provide the necessary documents listed below.
5. Pay the required fee.

## Required Documents
- Valid identification (mostly your passport).
- Proof of accommodation, like a rental agreement or a purchased property.
- A document explaining your reasons to reside in Bulgaria (e.g., work contract, business documents).
- The printed confirmation of the paid application fee.
- For non-EU citizens, Bulgaria visa type D.

## Additional details
Remember that you must complete the procedure within 90 days of your entry into Bulgaria â€“ otherwise, you may face penalties. Additionally, EU citizens have the right to apply for permanent residence after five years of continuous legal residency in Bulgaria.

Also, note that the information provided applies to both, registering a new permanent address, and changing an existing one.

Please consult with legal professionals or contact the relevant authorities for the most current and precise information about the process.
