## Description
### What is it?
The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) is a free, personal card that helps EU citizens receive medical assistance during a temporary stay in any of the 27 EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The card entitles the holder to treatment under the same conditions and at the same cost as locals.

### Who needs it?
The EHIC is essential for any person living or traveling within the mentioned regions. It is particularly beneficial for people who plan to reside or work in these countries.

## Procedure
1. Visit the official website of the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) or an insurance company that has the permission to issue European Health Insurance Cards (EHIC).
2. Look for the application form for the EHIC.
3. Fill in the required details carefully and accurately. 
4. Attach the necessary documents (listed below) with your application.
5. Once completed, submit your application.
6. After your application has been reviewed and approved, your EHIC will be issued. 

## Required Documents
Your Identity Document (ID) or Passport - A valid ID or passport is needed to authenticate your identification.

Proof of Address - This could be a utility bill, a bank statement, or any official letter or document that includes your name and address.

## Additional details
The EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance; it does not cover private healthcare or return flights should you become seriously ill or injured abroad. It is essential to have both an EHIC and a valid private travel insurance policy covering health care in place before you travel.
