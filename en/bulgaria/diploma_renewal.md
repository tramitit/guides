## Description
### What is it?
Diploma renewal is a process of updating one's educational certification due to various reasons, such as a change in the curriculum, a change in personal information, or more.

### Who needs it?
This process is important for individuals whose academic diploma is outdated in terms of structure or content. It also applies to individuals who have encountered significant changes in their personal information, for instance, a name change.

## Procedure
Unfortunately, without directly referenced information, it's not possible to provide a detailed, step-by-step procedure. Generally, diploma renewal might involve the following:

1. Contacting the issuing institute: You need to get in touch with your university or school that issued the diploma in the first place.
2. Submission of required documents: Submit all the necessary documents, including the original diploma and your ID. 
3. Payment of the fee: Pay the required fee for the service.
4. Delivery: Wait for the processing time until the renewed diploma is handed over to you.

## Required Documents
The list of required documents might include, but is not limited to, the following:

- Original Diploma: The diploma that is subjected to renewal must be presented.
- Photo Identity Proof: Any government-issued photo ID can be used to verify your identity.
- Application Form: You have to fill out an application form stating the reasons for the renewal request.
