## Description
### What is it?
Child benefits are payments that you can get for each child you’re responsible for. Whether you qualify or not and how much you might get depends on your specific family situation.

### Who needs it?
Anyone responsible for a child (under 16 years old, or under 20 if they remain in approved education or training) may be eligible for child benefits.

## Procedure

1. Firstly, you need to ascertain your eligibility. The rules are complex and it could be beneficial to get individual advice for your situation from agencies or welfare rights organizations who specialize in these facts.

2. Once you’ve established that you are indeed eligible for child benefits, the next step is to apply for them. The application can be initiated via this [link](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit). 

3. Fill out the form accurately. Make sure all details are correctly filled in to avoid any delays in the processing of your application.

4. Attach all required documents (details below). Again, ensure that all requested details are properly provided.

5. Submit the form either online or via mail, depending on the instructions. After submission, a response or acknowledgement should be received.

6. If successful, your child benefits will be delivered either into your bank, building account, or by cheque.


## Required Documents

- Birth or adoption certificate for each child you are applying for.
- Your National Insurance number.
- If you’re an immigrant, your date of entry into the country.
