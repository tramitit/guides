## Description
### What is it?
A residence permit is a document that gives a foreigner the right to reside in a country for a specified period of time. This guide focuses on the issuance of such a permit in the country of Bulgaria.

### Who needs it?
Non-Bulgarian residents who plan to stay in Bulgaria for an extended period of time, typically greater than 90 days, must acquire a residence permit. It is also necessary for those who intend to work, study or engage in other long-term activities in the country.

## Procedure
1. Start by securing a long-term D Visa from a Bulgarian consulate in your country of current residence. This visa is valid for 6 months but permits a stay of up to 180 days.
2. Once you have arrived in Bulgaria with your valid D Visa, apply for a residence permit at the Migration Directorate in Sofia or a regional Migration office within the country.
3. Fill out the necessary application form and provide all required supporting documents (see below).
4. Pay the required application fees.
5. If all documents are found satisfactory, the residence permit would be issued.

## Required Documents
- Valid passport.
- Proof of address in Bulgaria.
- Proof of health insurance valid in Bulgaria.
- Proof of financial resources to support your stay in Bulgaria.
- Documents to support the purpose of your stay (employment contract, letter of acceptance from an educational institution, etc)
