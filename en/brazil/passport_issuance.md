## Description
### What is it?
The Brazilian passport issuance service is a government-managed process that allows Brazilian citizens to apply for and receive their official travel document. This service ensures that individuals meet all necessary legal requirements and provides them with a passport that can be used for international travel.

### Who needs it?
This service is ideal for Brazilian citizens who plan to travel abroad, either for leisure, business, or educational purposes. It is also essential for those who need a valid form of identification that is recognized internationally. Additionally, dual nationals who hold Brazilian citizenship may require this service to renew an expired or soon-to-expire passport.
