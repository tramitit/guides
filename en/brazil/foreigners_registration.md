## Description
### What is it?
The Foreigners' Registration service in Brazil is a mandatory process for non-citizens who plan to stay in the country for an extended period. This process involves obtaining an RNE (Registro Nacional de Estrangeiros) or CRNM (Carteira de Registro Nacional Migrat√≥rio), which serves as an identification card for foreign residents. This registration is crucial for legal residency, work permits, and accessing various public services.

### Who needs it?
This service is essential for anyone who intends to stay in Brazil for an extended period, including expatriates, individuals marrying Brazilian citizens, workers with long-term contracts, students, and retirees. Additionally, those with Brazilian ancestry or dual citizenship may need to navigate this process to ensure compliance with local laws.

2. Make an appointment at the local Federal Police office.
3. Fill out the necessary forms online and print them.
4. Attend the appointment with all required documents and forms.
5. Pay the registration fee at a designated bank.
6. Submit the payment receipt and documents at the Federal Police office.
