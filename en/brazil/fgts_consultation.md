## Description
### What is it?
The FGTS (Fundo de Garantia do Tempo de Serviço) Consultation service in Brazil allows workers to verify and manage their employment-related savings. The FGTS is a fund established by the Brazilian government to protect workers dismissed without just cause, and it is comprised of monthly deposits made by employers. This service facilitates the checking of FGTS balances, transaction histories, and compliance with legal deposits by employers.

### Who needs it?
This service is indispensable for Brazilian employees, especially those who are currently working under the CLT (Consolidated Labor Laws) regime. It benefits workers who need to track their FGTS contributions, verify their savings, ensure compliance by their employers, or prepare for potential financial needs such as housing, retirement, or emergency expenditures.
