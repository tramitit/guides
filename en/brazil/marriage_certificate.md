### Who needs it?
This service is ideal for Brazilian citizens, foreign nationals marrying a Brazilian, or couples seeking legal recognition of their marriage in Brazil. It is especially relevant for those navigating the Brazilian bureaucracy for the first time, expatriates living in Brazil, and anyone needing to retrieve a past marriage certificate for legal or personal purposes.

2. Submit a 'Notice of Intended Marriage' and any required documents.
3. Schedule and attend a marriage interview if necessary.
