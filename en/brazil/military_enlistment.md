## Description
### What is it?
Military enlistment in Brazil is a mandatory service for male citizens aged 18 and above. The conscription process requires young men to register, ensuring their eligibility for military service. If they are not selected for active duty, they are still categorized as reservists, which requires them to participate in occasional training and other military-related activities.

### Who needs it?
This service is essential for Brazilian male citizens turning 18, dual citizens residing in Brazil, and individuals born abroad to Brazilian parents but wish to reside in Brazil. It is especially important for those planning to pursue public sector jobs or higher education, as proof of military service compliance is often required.

2. **Fill Out Forms**: Complete the necessary forms with accurate personal information.
3. **Document Submission**: Submit the required documents either online or at a designated military board.
4. **Attend Evaluation**: Follow the instructions to attend a physical and psychological evaluation.

6. **Receive Certificate**: If not selected for active duty, obtain your military service certificate (Certificado de Dispensa de Incorporação).
