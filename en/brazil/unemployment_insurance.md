## Description
### What is it?
Unemployment insurance in Brazil, known as 'Seguro Desemprego', is a social benefit provided by the government to assist workers who have been laid off. It aims to offer temporary financial assistance while they seek new employment. This benefit is available to formal workers registered with the government, domestic workers, and various other categories, ensuring financial stability during periods of unemployment.

### Who needs it?
