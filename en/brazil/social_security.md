## Description
### What is it?
Social Security in Brazil, known as 'Previdência Social,' is a governmental system designed to provide financial support to Brazilian residents through pensions, disability benefits, and other welfare programs. This service is fundamental for retirees, individuals with disabilities, and those in need of social protection.

### Who needs it?
This service is essential for Brazilian citizens and residents who are retired, disabled, or in need of financial assistance due to unemployment or low income. It is particularly useful for older adults, individuals with disabilities like autism, and families requiring economic relief.

## Procedure

2. Visit the official INSS (Instituto Nacional do Seguro Social) portal and create an account if you don't have one.
3. Navigate to the appropriate section for your specific benefit (pension, disability, etc.).
4. Fill out the application form with the required information.
5. Submit your application and wait for confirmation and further instructions.
6. Attend any required assessments or provide additional documentation as requested.
7. Receive confirmation of your benefit approval and disbursement details.
