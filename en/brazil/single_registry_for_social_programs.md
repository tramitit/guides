## Description
### What is it?
The Single Registry for Social Programs, known as CadÚnico, is a Brazilian government initiative designed to identify and register low-income individuals and families for the purpose of integrating and distributing social benefits.

### Who needs it?
The ideal users of the Single Registry are Brazilian low-income families and individuals earning up to half of the minimum wage per person or a total family income of up to three times the minimum wage. This service is vital for those seeking governmental social benefits and aids aimed at enhancing quality of life.
