## Description
### What is it?
A Work Card (Carteira de Trabalho) in Brazil is an essential document that records your employment history and ensures your labor rights. It is legally required for all formal employment arrangements and is issued by the Ministry of Labor.

### Who needs it?
The ideal customer is any individual, both Brazilian citizens and foreigners, seeking formal employment in Brazil. This includes recent graduates entering the workforce, experienced professionals changing jobs, and foreigners who have received a job offer in Brazil.

## Procedure

1. Obtain a copy of your ID (e.g., RG for Brazilians, passport for foreigners).
2. Obtain your CPF (Cadastro de Pessoa Física) from a local Receita Federal office or certain post offices and banks.
3. Schedule an appointment through the official Ministry of Labor website or visit the nearest Poupatempo (in São Paulo) or regional labor office.
4. Attend your appointment with all required documents for verification and processing.
5. Receive your Work Card, typically on the same day or within a short period.


## Required documents

- RG (Brazilian ID) or Passport (for foreigners) - obtain from local civil registry offices or embassies.
- CPF (Cadastro de Pessoa Física) - obtainable from Receita Federal, post offices, or selected banks.
