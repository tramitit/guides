## Description
### What is it?
The Tax Exemption Declaration service is designed to help Brazilian expatriates formally declare their exit from Brazil, ensuring they are exempt from the country's tax obligations. This service provides a structured process to inform the Federal Revenue of Brazil (Receita Federal) about their definitive departure, preventing any tax complications in the future.

### Who needs it?
This service is ideal for Brazilian citizens who have moved abroad and do not intend to return to Brazil in the foreseeable future. Expats who have not declared their definitive exit and wish to avoid potential tax obligations in Brazil can greatly benefit from this service.

## Procedure

1. Gather necessary documents such as proof of residence abroad and identification.
2. Log into the Receita Federal's online portal.
3. Fill out the 'Comunicação de Saída Definitiva do País' form available on the portal.
4. Submit the form along with scanned copies of required documents.
5. Await confirmation from the Receita Federal, which may take a few weeks.
6. Once confirmed, ensure you keep a copy of your declaration and any receipts for future reference.


## Required documents

- Proof of Residence Abroad: Obtain a utility bill or rental agreement in your name from your current country of residence.
- Identification: Use your Brazilian CPF and a copy of your passport.
- Previous Income Tax Returns: Gather your last few tax returns filed in Brazil.
