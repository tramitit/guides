## Description
### What is it?
An International Driving Permit (IDP) allows tourists and expatriates to legally drive in Brazil, complementing their home country’s driver's license. This document translates your license information into multiple languages, making it easier for local authorities to comprehend your driving credentials.

### Who needs it?
Ideal for tourists, expatriates, and business travelers who plan to rent or drive a car in Brazil. If you want to explore Brazilian cities, remote areas, or undertake long drives during your stay, an IDP is a critical document to have. It ensures compliance with local traffic regulations and avoids potential legal complications.

## Procedure

1. Check eligibility: Ensure that you possess a valid driver’s license in your home country.
2. Visit your local automobile association: Find your home country’s authorized agency for issuing IDPs.
3. Fill out the application form: Provide necessary personal and driver’s license information.
4. Submit required documents: Include photographs and any additional required identification.
5. Pay the service fee: Applicable fees vary by country and agency.
6. Receive your IDP: Your permit will be processed and mailed to you.
