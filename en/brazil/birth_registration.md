## Description
### What is it?
Birth registration in Brazil is a crucial legal process that records a person's birth to establish their Brazilian citizenship and acquire necessary documents such as a CPF (Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas) and passport. This service is essential, especially for Brazilians born abroad or individuals claiming citizenship by descent, ensuring their legal rights and access to services within the country.

### Who needs it?
This service is essential for Brazilian expats, their descendants born abroad, and anyone discovering their eligibility for Brazilian citizenship. It is also crucial for new parents needing to register their child's birth, individuals updating their Brazilian documents, and foreigners marrying in Brazil. Ideal users are those looking to solidify their legal status, obtain important identification documents, or comply with Brazilian law.

## Procedure

1. Gather all necessary documents including birth certificates, parents' IDs, and marriage certificates if applicable.
2. Translate all non-Portuguese documents through a certified translator.
3. Schedule an appointment at the nearest Brazilian consulate or civil registry office in Brazil.
4. Submit all required documents to the consulate or registry office.
5. Complete any required forms and pay the applicable fees.
