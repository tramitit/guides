## Description
### What is it?
A death certificate is a legal document providing proof of death, date of occurrence, and the personal details of the deceased. 

### Who needs it?
People who are settling the deceased's legal and financial affairs, including family members, legal representatives, and anyone else needing proof of death.

## Procedure
1. You need to report the death to the local Civil Registry Office (`Lixiarchio`) where the person passed away within three business days [10 Days of Death Reporting Law](http://www.et.gr/idocs-nph/search/pdfViewerForm.html?args=5C7QrtC22wFqn3SuuYvHOdtvSoClrL8hP6_J2_LCDax5MXD0LzQTLWPU9yLzB8V68knBzLCmTXKaO6fpVZ6Lx3UnKl3nP8NxdnJ5r9cmWyJWelDvWS_18kAEhATUkJb0x1LIdQ163nV9K--td6SIuSWKqOir9-8v2vvNo90krBzEY#tab-3).
2. You need to bring a medical death certificate (issued by the doctor who confirmed the death) to the Civil Registry Office.
3. The Civil Registry Office will create a 'Death Declaration' (`Dilosi Thanatou`) which should be signed by two relatives within four degrees of kinship or, if this canâ€™t be provided, by two witnesses that know about the death.

## Required Documents
- Medical death certificate
- Deceased's ID card
- In case of hospital or institution death, a certificate issued by the head of the hospital or institution
- Information about the deceased (full name, profession, residence, marital status, name of spouse, names of parents)
