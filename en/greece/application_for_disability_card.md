## Description
### What is it?
A disability card, also known as the Disability Living Allowance (DLA), is a document proving that the holder has some health condition that gives them certain rights and aids, depending on the country and its laws. In Greece, it is used to access free or discounted services.

### Who needs it?
It is essential for individuals with disabilities, chronic illnesses, or any other health condition that impairs their daily living activities. It offers benefits like free entry or discounts at various places and events.

## Procedure
1. Prepare a medical report declaring your condition. This has to be certified and stamped by a registered doctor.
2. Submit your application to the Ministry of Health, along with the required documents.
3. Wait for the application processing. The waiting period could vary depending on the applicant's situation.
4. Finally, if your application gets approved, you’ll receive the disability card.

## Required Documents
- An medical report that declares your disability or health condition.
- Proof of residence
- Identification document—passport or any other form of ID

Please ensure all documents are translated in Greek as you are applying within Greece.
