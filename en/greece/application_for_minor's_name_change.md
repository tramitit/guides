## Description
### What is it?
This is a legal procedure to change the name of a minor. This process requires legal steps and approval from the court system.

### Who needs it?
This procedure is necessary for guardians who wish to change the name of the child under their care, for a variety of reasons such as personal beliefs, cultural reasons, or after major life changes like adoption or parental separation.

## Procedure
1. Obtain a petition for the name change from your local county's court. In most states, this is the Probate or Family Court.
2. Complete the petition. Typically, you'll need the minor's current name, proposed name, reasons for name change, and the consent of both parents or legal guardians.
3. Filings of Applications in the court, along with the required fee.
4. The next step usually involves scheduling a court hearing. The court will notify you of the hearing date.
5. Attend the hearing.
6. If the judge approves the name change, they will issue a decree to this effect.
7. After getting the decree, update the name with Social Security Administration, schools, and other relevant bodies.

## Required Documents
* Proof of guardianship: Typically, a birth certificate or court document showing you have custody of the minor.
* Proof of consent from other parent (if applicable): This may be obtained through a signed form or the other parent appearing in court.
* The court's petition form filled out completely.
* Fee for application (varies by locality).
