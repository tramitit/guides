## Description
### What is it?
A residence permit is an official document required for non-European Union citizens who wish to reside in Greece for more than three months.

### Who needs it?
Any non-European Union citizen planning to stay in Greece for over three months for work, education, or other reasons.

## Procedure

1. **Entry Visa**: First, you will need an entry visa to enter Greece. You can apply for this at the Greek embassy or consulate in your home country [ows Consular Services](http://www.mfa.gr/).
2. **Blue Certificate**: After arriving in Greece, apply for a 'Blue Certificate' which is from the Aliens Bureau. This serves as a temporary document while your residence permit is being processed.
3. **Preparation**: Gather the necessary documents for the application of the permit. These vary depending on the purpose of your stay (i.e., work, education, etc.).
4. **Application**: Submit your application in person at the respective Immigration office [Migration and Residence Permit services](http://www.ypes.gr/).
5. **Collection**: Once your permit is ready, you will receive a notification to go and collect it. 

## Required Documents
The documents required will depend on the type of residence permit you're applying for. Generally, you will need:

- Valid Passport
- Proof of health insurance
- Proof of sufficient financial resources
- Biometric data (photograph and fingerprints)
- Proof of purpose (labor contract, acceptance letter from a University, etc.)

Keep in mind that Greece is part of the European Union, so some procedures can be different for EU and non-EU citizens. Also, be prepared for potential delays in processing and be patient with the procedure.
