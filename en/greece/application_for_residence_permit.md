## Description
### What is it?
A residence permit is an official document required for non-European Union citizens who wish to reside in Greece for more than three months.

### Who needs it?
Any non-European Union citizen planning to stay in Greece for over three months for work, education, or other reasons.

## Procedure

1. **Entry Visa**: First, you will need an entry visa to enter Greece. You can apply for this at the Greek embassy or consulate in your home country [ows Consular Services](http://www.mfa.gr/).
2. **Blue Certificate**: After arriving in Greece, apply for a 'Blue Certificate' which is from the Aliens Bureau. This serves as a temporary document while your residence permit is being processed.
3. **Preparation**: Gather the necessary documents for the application of the permit. These vary depending on the purpose of your stay (i.e., work, education, etc.).
4. **Application**: Submit your application in person at the respective Immigration office [Migration and Residence Permit services](http://www.ypes.gr/).
5. **Collection**: Once your permit is ready, you will receive a notification to go and collect it. 

## Required Documents
The documents required will depend on the type of residence permit you're applying for. Generally, you will need:

- Valid Passport
- Proof of health insurance
- Proof of sufficient financial resources
- Biometric data (photograph and fingerprints)
- Proof of purpose (labor contract, acceptance letter from a University, etc.)

## Additional details
Make sure to check the specific requirements for the type of residence permit you're applying for, as different types can have different requirements and processes. Keep in mind that Greece is part of the European Union, so some procedures can be different for EU and non-EU citizens. Also, be prepared for potential delays in processing and be patient with the procedure.
