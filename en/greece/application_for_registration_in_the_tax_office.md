## Additional details
This tax number (AFM) is a compulsory requirement and is used in all interactions with any Greek authority and is necessary for almost all transactions of economic significance, like opening a bank account, setting up utility contracts, getting paid for work, and more. The Tax Office will check the validity of the documents and may potentially ask for further evidences or certificated translations of foreign documents, so it is essential that all provided documents are accurate to avoid any delays in the process.
