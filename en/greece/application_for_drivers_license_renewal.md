## Description
### What is it?
Renewing a driver's license in Greece involves a series of steps to ensure the applicant is still fit and legally able to operate a vehicle.

### Who needs it?
This process is required for anyone who holds a Greek driver's license, especially those that are nearing expiration.

## Procedure
1. Ensure you meet the criteria to renew your driver's license. 
2. Schedule an appointment with a certified driver's license physician for a health check-up to ensure you are fit to operate a vehicle. It's important to note that vision tests are typically included in these examinations. 
3. After the examination, obtain a medical certificate from the examining physician.
4. Submit the necessary documentation including your expiring driver's license and medical certificate, to the Transportation Department (Υπουργείο Μεταφορών) or a KEP Citizen Service Centre. 
5. Upon successful verification of submitted documents, pay the necessary renewal fee.
6. Photographs are typically taken in the office at the time of renewal. Once your photo has been taken, a temporary license might be issued while you wait for your new license. 

## Required Documents
1. Your current or recently expired driver's license 
2. Medical Fitness Certificate - obtained from a certified physician. 
3. Two recent passport-size photographs
