## Description
### What is it?
Employee hiring notification is a formal process where an organization announces the employment of a new staff member. This is useful for ensuring that all team members are informed of new hires, their roles, and responsibilities, and it aids in the welcome and integration process of the new employee.
### Who needs it?
Company owners, Human Resources (HR) departments, managers, and anyone involved in the recruitment process will find this information useful. 

## Procedure

1. Obtain the new employee's personal information, including their role, department, and start date.
2. Prepare a written announcement. This should contain welcomes, introductions and the employee’s job role (be sure to maintain their privacy).
3. Disseminate the announcement. Choose the right communication channel, which may be email, team meeting, or intranet post.
4. Plan the employee's introduction to their immediate team. This could be done through a meet-and-greet, a welcome lunch, or a brief introduction at a team meeting.
5. Ensure that the new employee feels welcomed and comfortable. 
6. Encourage two-way communication. Let your employees ask questions or provide input about the new hire.

## Required Documents
New hire details that are needed will vary according to company policy, but common ones include:
- Full Name
- Role or Position
- Department or Team
- Brief professional background (be sure to respect privacy rules)

## Additional details

It’s important to keep the announcement professional and respectful. Remember, you're welcoming a new team member - the focus should be on making them feel welcomed and appreciated. Also, bear in mind that unprofessional or poorly handled announcements can lead to difficult first impressions. Be careful with personal information to avoid privacy issues.
