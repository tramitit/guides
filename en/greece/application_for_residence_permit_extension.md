### Who needs it?
Any foreign citizen legally staying in Greece who wishes to extend their stay beyond the date their current residence permit expires.

## Procedure
1. Start the application process around two months before your current residence permit expires.
2. Collect all the required documents (see the list below).
3. Visit the [Greek Immigration Services website](http://www.ypes.gr/) to find your local immigration office.
4. Submit your application in person at the immigration office. 

## Required Documents
- Proof of stable and regular resources sufficient to maintain yourself without recourse to the social assistance system of Greece.
- Proof of comprehensive health insurance.
- You may also need evidence of accommodation such as rental contract or property ownership papers.

(Note: For more specific details on the required documents, it is always best to consult the [Greek Immigration Services website](http://www.ypes.gr/))

## Providers that can do it for you

There is no specific provider for this, the residence permit extension application has to be submitted directly to the Greek Immigration Services.

## Additional details
The process may vary slightly depending on the specific municipality. If there is missing information or documents, the process may take longer, so it is advisable to start ahead of time. For any queries or complications, feel free to directly contact the local immigration office or the [Greek Ombudsman](https://www.synigoros.gr/).
