## Description
### What is it?
A Permanent Residence Certificate is a legal document that validates a person's right to live indefinitely within Greece. It is issued by Greek authorities and is applicable to non-Greek residents fulfilling certain eligibility criteria.

### Who needs it?
Non-native individuals who have been living in Greece for a significant period (generally more than 5 years) and intend to stay indefinitely can apply for this certificate.

## Procedure
1. Assemble the necessary documents.
2. Visit the local town hall or KEP (Citizens Service Centre).
3. Submit the assembled documents. 
4. Upon approval of your application, you will receive your certificate of permanent residence.

## Required Documents
* Proof of identity (passport or identity card)
* Documentation proving continuous and legal stay for 5 years in Greece (e.g., tax returns, rent receipts, utility bills)
* Two recent, color photos 
* Any other relevant supporting documents (employment contract, property deeds, etc.)

## Providers that can do it for you

## Additional details
* This process can take several weeks or even months, depending on the backlog of applications and the thoroughness of local authorities.
* The permanent residence certificate does not expire.
* The permanent residence certificate does not automatically grant employment rights but it makes the process of getting work permits easier. 
* Brexiteers (UK citizens living in Greece before Brexit) require a biometric permit to stay, not the certificate of permanent residence.
