## Description
### What is it?
An inheritance certificate is a legal document that recognises an individual as the rightful heir to the properties and assets of a deceased person. This document is necessary when one or more assets are left in the name of the deceased person and need to be transferred to the heir(s) in line with the law.
### Who needs it?
Primarily, this document is indispensable for individuals who are identified as heirs in a will or statutory heirs (children, spouse, parents, etc.) in absence of a will. However, the application process may vary based on the country's respective laws where the properties or assets are located.

## Procedure
1. Identify the need for an inheritance certificate. If you are an identified heir and there are properties or assets to be inherited, you will need this certificate.
2. Gather all the necessary paperwork, which is generally a death certificate, proof of relation to the deceased, and a proof of the respective assets and properties.
3. In the case where properties or assets are located in Greece, hire a lawyer in Greece to guide you through the process. The lawyer will file a declaration of inheritance on your behalf at the local tax office.
4. The lawyer will subsequently apply for and obtain the inheritance certificate.
5. Once the inheritance certificate is granted, the transfer of property and assets can be executed.

## Required Documents
Documents largely depend on the type of assets and country of the deceased but commonly include:
- Death certificate of the deceased
- Birth certificates or other proof of relation between the deceased and the heirs
- Documents reflecting assets and properties of the deceased
