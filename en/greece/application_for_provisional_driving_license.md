## Description
### What is it?
A Provisional Driving License is a license that allows you to learn to drive with a qualified driving instructor or an experienced driver, in preparation for a driving test. It is a pre-requisite before you can take your driving test and get a full driving license in the UK.

### Who needs it?
This is ideal for Greek residents wanting to learn to drive in the UK. 

## Procedure
1. Verify your eligibility. You must be at least 39 days away from your 17th birthday if you want to drive a car.
2. Prepare your identification documents. A foreign national ID card, such as a Greek ID card, can be used as proof of identification along with other essential documents.
3. Create a [Government Gateway ID](https://www.access.service.gov.uk/login/signin/creds) if you don’t already have one.
4. Apply via the [GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/apply-first-provisional-driving-licence). Follow the website's guidelines and fill up necessary forms with accurate information.
5. Pay the application fee (£34 as of the time of this guide). The website accepts debit or credit card payments.

## Required Documents
You will typically need:
- A valid Greek ID card or any other valid proof of identification
- Proof of residence
- Passport-style color photograph
- Details of previous or current provisional driving licenses
