## **Description**
### What is it?
Applying for Greek citizenship is the process of becoming a national of Greece through descent, marriage, or naturalization (residence). As a Greek citizen, you gain certain rights including the right to vote, right to work, access to healthcare, and more.

### Who needs it?
This service is crucial for individuals of Greek descent or individuals married to Greek nationals who desire to become Greek citizens. It is also important for foreign nationals residing in Greece who meet the requisites for naturalization.

## **Procedure**

1. Determine your eligibility through either descent, marriage, or residence.
2. Prepare the necessary documents (see Required Documents section).
3. Submit the application along with the required documents at the nearest Greek consulate/embassy or the Greek Ministry of Interior if you are in Greece.
4. Conduct an interview in Greek confirming your knowledge of the Greek language. 
5. Await the decision on your application. This process may take up to twelve months.

## **Required Documents**

- A completed citizenship application form.
- A valid passport or another form of identification.
- If applying through descent, a verified ancestral record proving Greek origin is required.
- If applying through marriage, a valid marriage certificate, and proof of grasp of Greek culture, history, and language, may be required.
- If applying through residence, proof of continuous residence in Greece for more than seven years.
- Additional documents may be required as per the applicant's unique situation, consult your nearest Greek embassy/consulate for more specifics.

**Note:** The exact documents required can vary depending on factors like the applicant's age, marital status, legal status in Greece, education level, etc.

## **Additional details**

Please note that the Greek nationality law operates on the principle known as 'jus sanguinis,' meaning nationality or citizenship is not determined by place of birth but by having one or both parents who are citizens of the state. Therefore, those of Greek descent have a considerably straightforward process when applying for citizenship.

Also, bear in mind that Greek laws require mandatory military service for males once they acquire citizenship. This applies to males between the ages of 18 to 45.

The above information provides a basic guide on how to apply for Greek citizenship. It is always best to speak to a legal expert or consult with the nearest Greek embassy/consulate for the most accurate and updated information.
