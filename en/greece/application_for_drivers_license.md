## Description
### What is it?
A driver's license is an official document, often plastic and the size of a credit card, permitting a specific individual to operate one or more types of motorized vehicles, such as a motorcycle, car, truck, or bus on a public road.

### Who needs it?
It's an essential document for anyone intending to drive a motor vehicle. If you are over the age of 18 and intending to drive in Greece, you will need to apply for a driver's license.

## Procedure
1. Find a suitable driving school in your local area - they will inform you of all required documentation and fees, and help you prepare for the theoretical (knowledge) and practical (driving) exams.
2. Pass the theory test - this includes questions about rules on the road, driving safety, and sometimes basic mechanical knowledge. 
3. Complete driving school course and pass the practical exam - this is where you'll get behind the wheel to show your driving skills.
4. Following the successful completion of these steps, you will be issued your new Driverâ€™s License.

## Required Documents
1. Passport or other acceptable identification
2. Recent Color Photo
3. Application form (provided by driving school)
4. Medical Fitness Certificate

## Additional details
It may be possible for drivers with a driver's license issued by a non-EU/EEA country to convert their driving permit to a Greek one. The exact rules vary, so it's recommended to check with the Ministry of Transport: [Ministry of Transport website](https://www.yme.gr/).

For those traveling to Greece as tourists and intend to drive, they may require an International Driving Permit, particularly if their driver's license is not in English. The rules can vary, so it's always a good idea to check prior to your visit. In order to obtain an International Driving Permit, one would typically apply in their home country prior to travel.

Remember, whether you're a seasoned driver or a newbie, always be mindful of the traffic rules and regulations in the country you're driving.
