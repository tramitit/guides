## Additional details
It may be possible for drivers with a driver's license issued by a non-EU/EEA country to convert their driving permit to a Greek one. The exact rules vary, so it's recommended to check with the Ministry of Transport: [Ministry of Transport website](https://www.yme.gr/).

For those traveling to Greece as tourists and intend to drive, they may require an International Driving Permit, particularly if their driver's license is not in English. The rules can vary, so it's always a good idea to check prior to your visit. In order to obtain an International Driving Permit, one would typically apply in their home country prior to travel.

Remember, whether you're a seasoned driver or a newbie, always be mindful of the traffic rules and regulations in the country you're driving.
