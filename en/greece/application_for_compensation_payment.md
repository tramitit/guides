## Description
### What is it?
Compensation payment is a form of payment that is given to an individual usually as a result of poor service, inconvenience, or as part of a contractual agreement such as commissioned work or employment. 

### Who needs it?
Anyone who may have suffered from a poor service they received or individuals expecting payment for their commissioned work or their earned salaries.

## Procedure
1. Identify the case: Understand why a compensation payment is needed. This could be in the form of an issue with a service provider, a commissioned job, or any other incident where a compensation payment would be appropriate.
2. Communicate: Reach out the party that owes the compensation. This could be via a written letter, email, or through an agreed communication channel. 
3. Documentation: Keep all records of your communication and any evidence of agreement or of the issue justifying the compensation.
4. Persistence: Follow up rigorously with the owing party, if necessary, offer alternatives or compromises to receive your compensation.
5. Legal Steps: If the owing party refuses to compensate, consider legal steps if the amount is worth the hassle.

## Required Documents
The Required documents will be mostly based on the nature of the compensation:
- Service Agreement: Any written agreement that indicates the details of the service or work provided.
- Evidence of Communication: Emails, chat history, letter, responses, etc., that show proof of communication.
- Proof of Non-Deposit: Bank statements or any other document that can prove that you have not received the expected compensation.

## Providers that can do it for you
Generally, the compensation procedure is something you would do individually. However, in certain cases, you may require legal help or a middleman, especially if it is tied to an employment contract or a commission-based job.
