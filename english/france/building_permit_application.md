## Description
#### What is it?
A building permit is a formal document required by the local or national government that allows for the construction or major alteration of a building structure within its jurisdiction. The process involves a detailed review of a proposed building project to ensure it complies with all zoning and building codes.
#### Who needs it?
A building permit is crucial for homeowners, contractors, or developers planning to construct a new building, carry out extensive repairs, renovations, or alter the use of an existing building. 

## Procedure

1. Identify your project: Define your construction project details. This includes the nature of the work, location, and size of the building, among others.

2. Get a design: You will need a detailed architectural design of your building project. This may require hiring a professional architect or engineer.

3. Application form: Obtain the official application form and carefully fill in the requested details.

4. Prepare documentation: Collect all necessary documents including your architectural design and property land title. 

5. Submission: Submit the application form alongside the required documents to the local authority or planning department. 

6. Review: The local authority will review your application and may request an on-site inspection.

7. Approval: Once the review is done and everything is in order, your building permit should be granted.
