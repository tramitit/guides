## Description
#### What is it?
The National Health Service (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, SSN) in Italy is a public health system that provides comprehensive health coverage to residents. 

#### Who needs it?
Anyone who is a resident in Italy, is eligible to register with the SSN. This includes Italian citizens, EU citizens, and non-EU citizens with a residence permit.

## Procedure
1. Visit your local health authority office (Azienda Sanitaria Locale / ASL). Find your local ASL using this link: [ASL Locator](http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/temi/p2_6.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=3680&area=Le%20ASL&menu=vuoto)
2. Complete a registration form for the SSN – ensure you have all required documents. 
3. Choose a family doctor from a list provided - known as a ‘medico di base’ or ‘medico di famiglia’.
4. Once your registration is processed, you receive a health insurance card (tessera sanitaria) in the mail.

NB: Coverage usually starts from the moment of registration and is valid for the calendar year, until December 31st.

## Required Documents
- Proof of identification (passport or ID card)
- Italian tax code (codice fiscale)
- Proof of residence or residence permit
- If you’re a salaried worker: a certificate from your employer
- If you’re a non-EU citizen: documents showing that you are legally staying in Italy

## Additional details
Remember to renew your registration every year. Although SSN coverage is comprehensive, some services might require co-payment (ticket). Always check whether your particular service requires this. Also, the SSN coverage may not extend during travels abroad, so an additional health insurance might be necessary for international travels.
