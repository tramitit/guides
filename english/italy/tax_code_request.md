## Description
#### What is it?
A Tax Code or Codice Fiscale is a tax identification number used in all interactions with government agencies and public administration in Italy. It's also required for various transactions including opening a bank account and signing a lease.

#### Who needs it?
Everyone planning to live, work, or study in Italy long-term needs a Tax Code (Codice Fiscale) - including foreigners who want to buy property or open a bank account.

## Procedure
1. You first need to visit the Italian consulate in your country to start the process. You can find the nearest consulate using this [link](http://www.esteri.it/mae/it/ministero/laretediplomatica/ambasciate/).
2. Submit an application for a tax code. A completed and signed [Form AA4/8](https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/documents/20143/255295/AA4_8.pdf/) is required.
3. After your application has been reviewed and approved, you will be issued the Codice Fiscale.

## Required Documents
To apply for a Codice Fiscale, you may need the following documents:

1. A valid passport or equivalent travel document valid for immigration purposes.
2. Proof of address (registration with the AIRE - [Registry of Italians Resident Abroad](https://www.aire.globalitaly.co.uk/apply-for-aire.aspx) - would suffice).
3. Completed and signed [Form AA4/8](https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/documents/20143/255295/AA4_8.pdf/).

## Providers that can do it for you

| Provider        |     Website     |     Timelines    |       Cost      |

## Additional details
Please note that the Codice Fiscale effectively corresponds to a tax residency. If you're just moving to Italy, you should request a tax code as soon as you arrive. If you're only planning to stay short-term or if you're working for a foreign company, you probably won't need a Codice Fiscale, but you should infirm yourself at the consulate. Please also consider every individual circumstance may require additional research.
