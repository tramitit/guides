## Description
#### What is it?
An Italian Passport is an imperative document for travel, allowing citizens to move across international borders with ease. This guide outlines the step-by-step process of obtaining an Italian Biometric Passport, which improves immigration and security procedures with its digitally stored personal information feature.

#### Who needs it?
This procedure is intended for all Italian citizens who are planning to travel abroad and do not currently possess a valid passport. This includes first-time applicants as well as individuals who need to renew an expired or soon-to-expire passport.

## Procedure
1. Make an online appointment with your nearest Italian Questura (Police Headquarters). Check the website of your local Questura for specific instructions.
2. Prepare all the required documents (see below).
3. Attend your scheduled appointment and submit all the necessary documents. You will also have your fingerprints taken.
4. Pay the required fee. This can usually be done at the Post Office or through an online payment system.
5. Wait for your passport to be processed. The average processing time varies, but it typically takes several weeks.
6. Once your passport is ready, you will need to collect it in person.

## Required Documents
- Proof of identity (ID card, driver's license, etc.)
- Proof of citizenship (birth certificate, certificate of citizenship, etc.)
- Two passport-sized photos
- Receipt of payment for the application fee

These passports offer a higher level of protection against fraud and counterfeiting attempts.
