## Description
#### What is it?
An identity card (Carta d'Identità) is a card containing a person's identification information. It's an official document issued by the government and is commonly used to establish one's identity within the country, especially in Italy.

#### Who needs it?
This is required for all Italian citizens and residents. Besides, visitors or tourists staying in hotels/hostels in Italy may be asked to show their ID cards as per the [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/voekoo/is_it_normal_for_hostelshotels_in_italy_to_ask/) on Reddit.

## Procedure
1. Go to the town hall (Comune) or other equivalent administrative branch of your city of residence.
2. Fill out the required application form.
3. Submit the required documents.
4. Pay the fee.
5. Once the identity card is ready, it may either be sent to your home address or you might need to pick it up yourself.

## Required Documents
- Proof of residence or domicile, generally a document or bill indicating your current address.
- Passport size photos that adhere to official specifications.
- Birth certificate or other proof of citizenship/residence status.

The documents needed might differ slightly depending on your city of residence, so it is always recommended to check with your local town hall.
